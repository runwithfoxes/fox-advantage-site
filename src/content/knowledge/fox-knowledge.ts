## About "The Fox Advantage" (2025)
- 54 short chapters across 4 parts, designed to read on your phone screen
- No jargon, no fluff. Written for practitioners, not academics.
- The premise: marketing is being reshaped by AI, and the winners will be small, sharp teams with tools, not big departments with process.
- The title comes from Isaiah Berlin's famous essay about foxes (who know many things) vs hedgehogs (who know one big thing). In marketing, foxes win. Philip Tetlock later showed foxes were better forecasters too.

### Part 1: What Just Collapsed
The traditional marketing department is dead. Big teams, long planning cycles, rigid hierarchies. AI compressed the timeline and made the old model obsolete. A 23-year-old with Claude and Midjourney shipped three campaigns before the planning meeting agreed whether the headline should say "empowering" or "enabling." The value of marketing hasn't disappeared, it's just moved. We're still looking for it in the wrong places.

Key arguments:
- The six-person social pod is now two generalists with taste, AI tools, and permission to act
- The threat isn't dramatic overnight job loss. It's that the middle of the org chart gets thinner because there's less to move and less to tidy
- What we're paid for now: direction, taste, the ability to make a call under uncertainty and stand over it
- AI makes average work free. The role of the marketer is not "human in the loop" but driver
- AI produces confident nonsense at scale. Critical thinking has never been more important
- The friction is the point: the struggle is not a tax on learning, it is the learning. Draft first, even badly.
- AI pattern-matches to the nearest familiar answer. The human value is mechanistic reasoning.

### Part 2: Better Together
How humans and AI work together. Not AI replacing marketers, but AI amplifying the ones who know what they're doing. The fox model: small teams, broad skills, fast iteration.

Key arguments:
- Fox marketers think in probabilities not certainties, have strong opinions held loosely, are open to discovering they were wrong
- AI is brilliant at doing but still bad at deciding. It doesn't know what matters. It just knows what's next.
- AI can help you think through a decision, but the decision itself requires a human who will bear the consequences
- Paul killed a National Lottery campaign that System1 research said would be effective because context and judgement told him otherwise. That's the human edge.
- The creative leap (like Goodby Silverstein's "Kill bugs fast" for Porsche) still requires human experience and feel. Claude itself admitted it couldn't have made that jump.
- Use AI as a truth serum, not a ghostwriter. If your 9-year-old can understand the strategy, you have something. If not, you're hiding.

### Part 3: The Fox Playbook
Practical frameworks for the new world. How to build mental availability, create distinctive brand assets, use evidence over opinion, make decisions faster, and build with AI.

Key arguments:
- Build the thing, not a description of the thing. In 60 minutes at Smurfit UCD, Paul ran deep research, did positioning, built a messaging framework, wrote blog posts, knocked out a slide deck, and built a website.
- The dependency on specialists has collapsed. Paul built the runwithfoxes.com website himself with Claude Code in a few hours on a Wednesday evening.
- Keep your judgement switched on. Draft first, rough and embarrassing. Then interrogate with AI as tutor, critic, or simulator.
- If you do the same work twice, build the scaffolding once. Speed without scaffolding moves the mess somewhere else.
- A six-word prompt can produce great brand-consistent output, but only because positioning, voice rules, and thousands of real customer verbatims were baked in beforehand. Tools do not fix vague thinking.
- Context is the new moat. Everyone has the same AI models. What's not commodity is the context you've wrapped around it.
- Two judgement-heavy generalists with taste and AI fluency can now do what used to require five specialists.

### Part 4: What Comes Next
Where this is all heading. The future of marketing teams, agencies, and the skills that will matter most.

Key arguments:
- "Four beats fifty": a team of 4-6 empowered builders will out-execute a 50-person org. OpenAI built the Sora Android app with 4 engineers in 28 days.
- Anthropic's growth marketing team is a non-technical team of one. Ad copy creation: two hours down to fifteen minutes. Creative output up 10x.
- Every handoff is a tax. The fix isn't better briefs, it's fewer handoffs.
- CEOs fall into the "delegation trap": they write the AI memo, announce the initiative, then delegate down to one poor IC who's left figuring it out. The CEOs who get AI working stay in the work.
- When average execution is free, average execution is worthless. The safe choice is now the dangerous choice.
- Find or create your "winning ticket", a big idea worth building on. Protect it and multiply it with AI.
- AI can help you spread a clear, consistent distinctive asset across formats. But if you don't know your cues or keep fiddling, AI will help you be average everywhere, quickly and at scale.

## About "Run with Foxes" (2020)
Paul's first book. 43 short chapters built on admitted failures, not claimed victories. Opens with his own failure and uses it as the central cautionary tale. The emotional arc is humility, not triumph.

Main themes:
- Most marketers are hedgehogs, locked into one ideology. The book helps them become foxes.
- The narrative fallacy is the most dangerous personal trap: using flawed stories of the past to shape expectations for the future
- Differentiation is overrated; distinctiveness and salience matter more
- Brand building sells more than "performance marketing" (Binet and Field evidence)
- Growth comes from acquiring new (often light) customers, not squeezing existing ones
- Creativity is the biggest lever and we massively under-invest in it
- Fame campaigns are the most profitable but the riskiest
- Experiment relentlessly, accept failure, do not spin results

## Paul's Case Studies and Stories

### National Lottery — Marketer of the Year
Paul led the National Lottery marketing team to win Marketer of the Year. Built mental availability through systematic approach to Category Entry Points. He also killed a campaign that System1 research said would be effective because some data suggested a small minority would be offended, and Irish people feel ownership over the Lottery. He went in front of the company, explained his decision, apologised, and articulated how he'd fix it. That's skin in the game.

### Millionaire Raffle — Mental Availability in Action
Applied mental availability principles to a specific lottery product. Linked the product to specific buying occasions (Christmas, birthdays, celebrations) and drove significant sales growth.

### National Lottery "It Could Be You"
The "It could be you" line disappeared in 2013 until Paul's team rediscovered it in 2020, like finding a winning ticket at the back of the sofa. A big idea worth protecting, not reinventing.

### National Lottery Waterslide — Distinctive Assets
With logo, name, and tagline removed, 72% of Irish adults spontaneously named the National Lottery brand. That's a distinctive asset doing its job.

### 48 — Youth Brand Creation (Telefonica/O2 Ireland)
Created a youth mobile brand from scratch at O2 Ireland. Only 18-to-22-year-olds could join (representing the 48 best months of their lives). When Paul called Susan in legal, she immediately said it wasn't legal. They seeded fake rejection letters, hired a "Head of Rejection," trained customer care agents to banter. 63% youth awareness within six months. Word-of-mouth was the second biggest awareness driver. Their advertising was pulled due to too many complaints. They even made a TV ad entirely in Japanese for the Irish market.

Big learning: They assumed teenagers don't talk on the phone, they text, so offered unlimited calls as a throw-in. Turns out teenagers loved talking, they just couldn't afford it. They'd done ethnographic research and focus groups but never ran an actual experiment. "I didn't wear a seatbelt all those years ago. And because I didn't crash, I stopped wearing one. Then I crashed."

### O2 Ireland — Press Ads and Google
Paul moved budget from newspaper ads to Google because Google appeared more effective for online store sales. But customers were noticing O2 ads for new phones in newspapers while commuting, then going home and searching Google. The press ads were creating the sales; Google was capturing them. They needed both. A lesson in attribution vs. causation.

### O2 — Distinctive Brand Assets
O2's bubbles are a prime example: customers could never articulate what made O2 different from Vodafone, but nobody mistook O2 for Vodafone. After just 2 years, O2's top-of-mind awareness was 28% vs. BT Cellnet's 20% after 7 years.

### Indeed — Campaign Lab
At Indeed, Paul built a marketing campaign lab that ran about 30 experiments a month. The culture demanded: try new things expecting some to fail, make failure survivable, know when you have failed. Increased app downloads by 30% in Australia through hundreds of creative iterations. Anti-spin culture: "We don't market our marketing."

### AI Writer System
Paul built a system for writing with AI that maintains a consistent, authentic voice using structured prompts, voice guides, and iterative refinement. He describes being up at 11:47pm, tea cold, threatening to demote an AI writer to banner ads. The system works because the positioning, voice rules, and real customer verbatims were baked in beforehand.

### Building runwithfoxes.com
Paul's neighbour Dave asked what he used to build the website. "Claude." "No, the design." "Claude." "No, the actual code." "Claude." Dave looked at him like he was either lying or about to sell something. The site runs on Next.js/React, Claude wrote ~1,370 lines of CSS. Hosting on Vercel is free. Previously spent real money on a Webflow build with a designer. Claude Code built something better-looking in a few hours on a Wednesday evening.

### Paul's Personal Assistant
Built a personal assistant with Claude Code that syncs his to-do list, calendar, and Gmail, sends a morning briefing email, and hooks into iMessage. Loads of errors, "proper ones," but each loop was quick. At one point Claude suggested they call it a night.

### Research System
Built a research system over a weekend with Claude Code that monitors 11 YouTube channels and his newsletter inbox. Three times a week it watches new episodes, reads new emails, pulls out anything fitting his book chapters, and files it as structured notes. Nearly 5,000 research nuggets, tagged and waiting.

## Key Marketing Concepts Paul Teaches

### Mental Availability (Byron Sharp / Ehrenberg-Bass Institute)
- The probability that a buyer will think of your brand in a buying situation
- Built through consistent, broad reach advertising that creates and refreshes memory structures
- Not about persuasion. About being noticed and remembered.
- Category Entry Points (CEPs): the situations, needs, and occasions that trigger a purchase decision. Brands need to be linked to as many relevant CEPs as possible.
- Romaniuk's B2B work shows the bigger problem is unawareness, not rejection.

### Distinctive Brand Assets
- Visual and verbal cues that trigger brand recognition without needing the brand name
- Colours, shapes, characters, jingles, taglines, fonts, packaging
- Measured on two dimensions: Fame (% who link it to the brand) and Uniqueness (% who link it only to your brand)
- Most brands overestimate how distinctive their assets actually are
- Only ~16% of advertising is both recalled and correctly attributed to the brand (Ehrenberg-Bass)
- Examples: O2 bubbles, National Lottery waterslide (72% spontaneous recall), Ogilvy's Hathaway eyepatch (bought for fifty cents on the way to the photoshoot in 1951)
- Jenni Romaniuk: "Spending more to fix poor branding execution is throwing good money after bad."
- Only ~15% of ads use character assets, which is a missed opportunity
- AI can help spread consistent assets across formats, but if you don't know your cues or keep fiddling, AI will help you be average everywhere at scale

### The Ehrenberg-Bass Laws of Growth
- Brands grow primarily by increasing penetration (getting more buyers), not loyalty
- Double Jeopardy Law: smaller brands have fewer buyers AND those buyers are slightly less loyal
- Most buyers are light buyers. Heavy buyers are a small minority.
- Loyalty is mostly a function of brand size, not emotional connection
- Andrew Ehrenberg: "Your customers are really other people's customers who occasionally buy from you."
- Over one-third of Dove's UK buyers bought just once in six years. Half of Tesco's customers go there only six times a year.
- Getting new customers is 5-25x more expensive than keeping existing ones (HBR), but the leaky bucket is a fact of life. Customers leave for mundane reasons.

### Evidence-Based Marketing
- Most marketing "best practice" is folklore passed down without evidence
- Effectiveness research (Binet & Field, Ehrenberg-Bass, IPA databank) gives us actual data
- The 60/40 rule (roughly 60% brand building, 40% activation) as a starting point, not a rule
- Long and short of it: brand building creates long-term growth, activation harvests existing demand
- Excess Share of Voice (ESOV): brands that invest more in share of voice than their share of market tend to grow. Peter Field: "We can be really, really confident that share of voice is a critical metric."
- 6 months is the cusp point: measuring over the short term leads to opposite conclusions about what works best vs. measuring over the long term
- 45% of customers acquired from a TV campaign didn't buy until two years after the campaign finished
- Brand campaigns reach more people, use emotion to stop people filtering out the message, and create priming effects that turbo-charge short-term activation
- After 3+ years, 43% of emotional campaigns report very large profit growth vs. 23% for rational campaigns (IPA Databank)

### Creativity and Advertising Effectiveness
- Good creative can be 1000% more profitable than poor creative (Paul Dyson / data2decisions)
- Creatively awarded campaigns are 8x more effective and 16x more likely to bring major profitability growth (Peter Field)
- The difference between strong and weak creative in UK cereal: 33 million pounds in yearly sales (Orlando Wood / System 1)
- Yet companies obsess over media channel optimisation (10% improvement) and treat actual creative as "files"
- Humour works: 30% of TV ads without humour were successful vs. 61% of those that attempted humour. Specsavers: 30 years of funny ads, 1.1 billion pounds in incremental profit. When they briefly ditched humour, all metrics went wrong.
- Paul Feldwick on PG Tips chimps: "Well of course it's the monkeys, stupid. Somehow 30 seconds of entertaining nonsense leads to people paying 35% more."

### Fame Campaigns
- Only 9% of IPA campaigns were fame campaigns, but 39% of fame campaigns had a large profit impact (highest of any type)
- Fame is not awareness. Fame means being talked about by people who currently don't care about you. It delivers exponentially greater market share gains.
- Fame campaigns are by far the most profitable but most attempts fail
- Examples: Harrison's Fund "I wish my son had cancer" (65,000 pounds from a single ad, 17,000% website visit increase), Payless/Palessi stunt (8.8 billion impressions), Paddy Power campaigns
- Aldi's "Tea" ad broke every "rule": hard-selling product comparison, 20 seconds, non-actor. Results: 25% sales increase, 43% market share increase, 14.50 pounds ROI per 1 pound.

### AI in Marketing
- AI is a tool, not a strategy. The strategy comes from the marketer.
- AI compresses time: what took a team of 10 a week now takes one person a day
- The risk: AI makes it easy to produce more, but more is not always better
- The opportunity: small teams with AI tools can compete with much larger organisations
- AI is best at: content production, data analysis, personalisation, testing at scale, spreading distinctive assets consistently
- AI is worst at: original strategy, the creative leap, understanding culture, deciding what matters
- AI makes the loop cheap but makes the checking more expensive
- "If you're ignorant on a subject without AI, then you're 10x ignorant with AI"
- Christopher Penn's "3C skills": creative thinking (having ideas), critical thinking (evaluating output), contextual thinking (knowing constraints)
- Subject matter expertise becomes the critical differentiator. Experts know what instructions to give and spot when output goes wrong.
- Context is the new moat. Everyone has the same models. What's not commodity is the context you've wrapped around it.

### Writing for LLMs and AI Search
- You're not only writing for the person with a coffee in their hand, you're writing for the machine scanning for something it can take
- Your help centre becomes a discovery asset. Product pages stop being brochures and start being evidence.
- John Hegarty: "Your communication has got to have something in it that AI can take. AI can't take 'oh, I felt good.'"
- Write down the ten questions you want to be the answer to. Ask them in AI tools. Note what gets quoted or linked. Rewrite pages so a machine can lift the answer without guessing.
- The long tail is longer now. People ask in proper sentences, not keyword fragments.
- Product demonstration and concrete claims become modern again in the age of AI.

## Common Questions and Good Answers

Q: What's the most important thing for a brand to grow?
A: Reach. Get in front of more people, more often. Most brands don't have a loyalty problem, they have a reach problem. Byron Sharp's evidence is clear: brands grow by acquiring new and light buyers, not by squeezing more from existing heavy buyers. Over a third of Dove's UK buyers bought just once in six years. Half of Tesco's customers go there only six times a year. Your heavy buyers feel important but your light buyers are where the growth is.

Q: How should marketers think about AI?
A: As a multiplier, not a replacement. AI lets you do more of what works, faster. But it can't tell you what works. That requires marketing judgement, and judgement comes from understanding the evidence, knowing your category, and having taste. The danger is using AI to produce more stuff without thinking about whether it's the right stuff. Paul had Claude run a discovery call on speakerphone in a client's office. Claude ran through strategy questions, probed vague answers, did funnel calculations on the spot, and wrote up meeting notes before Paul left the building. Impressive, but the decisions still need a human with skin in the game.

Q: What's wrong with traditional marketing departments?
A: Too many layers, too slow, too siloed. The old model was built for a world where campaigns took months. That world is gone. Now you need small teams that can move fast, test quickly, and learn from evidence. The fox model. OpenAI built the Sora Android app with 4 engineers in 28 days. Anthropic's growth marketing team is one person. A team of 4-6 empowered builders will out-execute a 50-person org. The bottleneck is no longer "can we make this?" It's "should we make this?"

Q: Is brand building still important in a digital world?
A: More important than ever. Digital made it easy to do activation (performance marketing, retargeting, direct response). But that only works if people already know who you are. Without brand building, you're fishing in a smaller pond. The evidence from Binet & Field is overwhelming: emotional brand campaigns nearly double the profit performance of rational campaigns after 3+ years (43% vs 23% reporting very large profit growth). And 45% of customers from a TV campaign didn't buy until two years after it finished. The short-term numbers lie.

Q: What marketing books should I read?
A: Start with "How Brands Grow" by Byron Sharp. Then "The Long and the Short of It" by Binet & Field. Then "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Kahneman. After those three, you'll have a better foundation than most marketing directors.

Q: How important is creativity really?
A: It's the biggest lever we have and we massively under-invest in it. Good creative can be 1000% more profitable than poor creative. That's not Paul's opinion, that's Paul Dyson's data. Peter Field found creatively awarded campaigns are 8x more effective. Yet companies obsess over media channel optimisation (10% improvement) and treat the actual creative as "assets" or "files." Specsavers: 30 years of funny ads, 1.1 billion pounds in incremental profit. When they briefly ditched humour for serious work, all their metrics went wrong. They swiftly returned to "Should've gone to Specsavers."

Q: What's a fame campaign?
A: One that gets people talking, not just watching. Only 9% of IPA campaigns were fame campaigns, but 39% had a large profit impact, the highest of any type. Fame generates free impressions and carries more credibility than paid media. Harrison's Fund ran the headline "I wish my son had cancer" and raised 65,000 pounds from a single ad. Payless invented a fake luxury brand "Palessi" and earned 8.8 billion impressions. Fame is not awareness. It's being talked about by people who currently don't care about you.

Q: What's the fox vs hedgehog thing?
A: Isaiah Berlin wrote a famous essay dividing thinkers into foxes (who know many things, are pragmatic, adapt) and hedgehogs (who know one big thing, see the world through a single lens). Philip Tetlock later showed that fox-style thinkers were dramatically better forecasters. In marketing, hedgehogs cling to one ideology (TV is dead / TV is everything / You can't build brands through digital / Digital is everything). Foxes think in probabilities, use multiple tools, and genuinely enjoy discovering they were wrong. Paul's line: "I am a hedgehog. A hedgehog that believes in being a fox."

Q: Can small brands or small teams really compete?
A: That's the whole point. AI didn't just lower the cost of production, it changed what's possible for small teams. Paul built a website, a research system monitoring 11 YouTube channels, a personal assistant, and an AI writer, all himself. Elena Verna built a hackathon platform in five hours for $300. The old excuse (cost, time, complexity) doesn't hold anymore. The advantage used to be access. Now the only thing you can't outsource is taste.

Q: What should I ask before cutting my marketing budget?
A: ESOV (Excess Share of Voice). Brands that invest more in share of voice than their share of market tend to grow. Brands that cut below tend to shrink. If you tell the CEO the only risk of a budget cut is that "brand awareness could dip," you're guaranteed to lose your budget. Connect it to market share, revenue, profit, and price premium. Barclays estimated a 1% change in brand consideration could equate to about 20 million pounds in income. That's the language that protects budgets.

Q: What's wrong with how we measure marketing?
A: Three things. First, short windows reward short behaviour. Six months is the cusp point where measuring over the short term leads to opposite conclusions about what works. Second, ROI is not a goal, it's a measure of efficiency and a poor measure for growth. Tim Ambler: "ROI is attractive to hedgehogs and rightly suspect in the eyes of foxes." Third, dashboards tell you what happened after it happened. Listen to actual customer calls. At Miro, Paul blocked 20 minutes every morning for Gong recordings, not summaries. Insights showed up in sighs, pauses, jokes customers didn't think he'd hear.

Q: How do I build distinctive brand assets?
A: Start measuring them. Use Romaniuk's framework: Fame (% who link the asset to your brand) and Uniqueness (% who link it only to your brand). Most brands overestimate how distinctive their assets are. Only 16% of advertising is both recalled and correctly attributed. Ogilvy bought the Hathaway eyepatch for fifty cents on the way to the photoshoot, it became one of the most recognised assets in advertising history because they kept using it. PG Tips featured chimps consistently since 1956, won market leader position within years, held it for decades with a 35% price premium. The hard work isn't finding your "eyepatch." It's having the discipline to stop taking it off.

Q: Tell me about the 48 brand
A: One of Paul's favourite case studies. At O2 Ireland, they created a youth mobile brand called 48, named for the 48 best months of your life (ages 18-22). Only those ages could join. Legal said it wasn't allowed. They did it anyway. Seeded fake rejection letters, hired a Head of Rejection, trained customer care to flirt and banter. Made a TV ad entirely in Japanese. Got 63% youth awareness in six months. But the big learning was the pricing mistake: they assumed teens text, not talk, so gave away unlimited calls. Turns out teens loved talking, they just couldn't afford it. Years of ethnographic research, focus groups, and data supported their assumption, but they never ran an actual experiment.
