# Chapter 19: Standards decide what stays

_Part 3_

This morning my mate sent me a screenshot from his bed, asking an AI to name his fantasy football team. It was 07:12, his phone was on 3% battery, and he’d typed “fanatsy” with a thumb that still had ketchup on it. It gave him ten names in a second. Deadly.


Then he used the same trick on a campaign brief and it spat out something that sounded smart, read clean, and said absolutely nothing.


Nothing magical happened to marketing. We didn’t get new laws of physics. We just got speed. And speed makes it easy to confuse output with progress.


You can feel it in the day to day. Someone drops a prompt into a tool, gets back three strategies, six taglines, and a polite rationale, all before the kettle boils. The room goes quiet for a second because it looks like work has been done. Then you read it and you realise it’s not work, it’s words.


Standards are what stop speed turning into noise.
They drag the old questions back onto the table. Who is this for, really, and who is it not for. What do they already believe before we arrive. What are we promising, in plain language. Why would they pick us over the thing they’re already using.
If you can’t answer those, AI will answer them for you. It will pick a segment, invent a desire, write a proposition, and make it all sound coherent. Then you build a campaign on top of it and wonder why the results feel thin.


This is also why “be an expert” is not a motivational poster. It’s practical. You need enough fundamentals in your hands that a clean sentence doesn’t hypnotise you.
