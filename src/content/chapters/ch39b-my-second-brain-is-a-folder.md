# Chapter 39b: My second brain is a folder

_Part 3_

I was watching a podcast the other morning, woman called Teresa Torres, and she said something that made me put my coffee down. She manages her entire life, tasks, research, notes, the lot, from a terminal window. No app. No Trello board. No Notion. Just text files in folders and an AI that reads them.

My first reaction was, that's mad. My second reaction, about four minutes later, was, I think I need that.

Because here's what had happened to me. I'd built the assistant. Chapter 39, the morning email, the iMessage tasks, the whole thing. And it worked. It genuinely worked. But my tasks lived in a JSON file that Claude could read but not really think about. My notes lived nowhere. My book draft was in a Word doc, my research was in a different folder, my ideas were in my head or scattered across texts I'd sent myself and half forgotten. I had pockets of order surrounded by chaos.

The fix was embarrassingly simple. One folder. Called it paul-hub. Inside that, a few sub-folders: tasks, notes, ideas, archive, daily. Every task is its own little text file. Every note is its own file. Every idea, same. Claude can see all of them, search all of them, tag all of them. I didn't learn a new tool. I didn't sign up for anything. I made some folders and put text in them.

Now when I type `/today` in the morning, Claude syncs whatever I've texted myself overnight, pulls my calendar, checks my email, looks through my task files, and builds me a daily briefing. One page. What's on, what's due, what's overdue, what needs attention. It also has a go at suggesting things it could just do for me. Sometimes it's right. Sometimes it's hilariously wrong. But it asks, which is more than most tools do.

The bit that changed things, really changed things, was notes. Now I take a note in a meeting by opening a file and typing into it. After the meeting I tell Claude to pull out any tasks. It reads the note, creates the task files, tags them. I didn't organise anything. I just typed and let Claude do the filing.

And here's the thing Teresa said that stuck. She keeps her context files small. Not one massive document about her business. Lots of tiny ones. Audience in one file. Products in another. Writing style in another. So when she asks Claude for help, it only loads what's relevant. It doesn't drag in everything and hope for the best. It picks what it needs.

That's the difference between giving someone a 2,000 page manual and giving them a tidy filing cabinet with labels. Both have the same information. One of them actually gets used.

I did the same. My writing style guide lives in one file. My business context in another. When I ask Claude to review a chapter, it loads the writing guide but not my task list. When I ask what's on my to-do list, it doesn't need to know how I write. Small files, right context, better answers.

The phone bit still works the same. I text myself. `task: chase Gary on pricing`. `note: Maya confirmed the budget`. It all lands in the right place next time I sync. I don't need my laptop for that. I don't need to open an app. I text like I'm telling a mate to remind me later.

The book ended up in there too. Forty-nine chapters, each one a separate file. I can ask Claude to find where I wrote about mental availability, or check if I've already used the Heineken story, or tell me which chapters contradict each other. That wasn't possible when it was one long document. Now every chapter is searchable, editable, connected to everything else.

Here's what I didn't expect. This setup does something that no task management tool I've ever used does. There are no predefined views. In Trello, you get a board. In Asana, you get a list. If you want a view they didn't build, tough. Here, every view is made on the fly. I ask "what's my sales pipeline?" and Claude generates it from the tags. I ask "what's overdue?" and it searches the due dates. I ask "find that thing about the agency" and it searches body text, filenames, tags, the lot. I didn't build any of those views. I just asked.

And nobody has to do the organising. In Trello, you create the card, you pick the list, you add the label, you set the date. Every time. Here, I type one lazy sentence and Claude does the filing. It picks the tags. It sets the date. It puts the file in the right folder. Teresa was right about this too. Nobody manually tags things consistently. We all start with good intentions and stop by Thursday. Claude does it every single time without being asked.

The real difference, the one that takes a while to feel, is that everything is connected. In Trello, your tasks can't see your notes. Your notes can't see your book chapters. Your book can't see your research. Here, Claude searches across all of it. I said "I wrote something about a bug last week, and I think I texted myself about it too" and Claude searched tasks, notes, inbox, archive, and found it. Even though I was remembering the words wrong.

It's not a product. It's a folder with some files and a few scripts. If Obsidian disappears, the files are still there. If Claude changes, the files are still there. There's no vendor lock-in because there's no vendor. Just text on a disk.

My old system stored tasks. This one understands them. And that's not a slogan. It's the practical difference between a tool that holds a list and a tool that can think about what's on it.

The best systems aren't the ones with the most features. They're the ones that match how you already think. I text myself. I take rough notes. I forget things constantly. So I built something that catches texts, stores rough notes, and finds the things I've forgotten. It doesn't ask me to change. It just gives me a place to be messy and sorts it out later.

Teresa called it being lazy with her prompts. I'd call it something else. Building a system that expects you to be human.
