# Chapter 28: The secret to success

_Part 3_

Last night I was in the playroom with my ten year old twin lads, two paperbacks open, a timer on my phone, and the kind of bargaining that’d make a hostage negotiator blush. Two chapters and you get screen time. Read 25 pages and I’ll buy you beastibles bars. 
Chocolate and Mr Beast. I know. I’m not proud. 


If you ask them what their dad says is the secret to success, they blurt it back, learn to love reading. Not ‘reading’ -  but learning to love it. If you ask them what their dad says is the secret to success, they blurt it back, learn to love reading. Not 'reading' but learning to love it.


They don't know why yet. They're ten. They think it's about school, or maybe getting a good job someday. But the thing I'm actually trying to transmit isn't about books at all. It's about the habit of wondering. The willingness to follow a thread when nobody's making you.


There's a story that stuck with me. Someone reflecting on their very first consultancy job. They did everything they were hired to do. Executed perfectly. Hit every deliverable. And they got fired. The reason, delivered without a hint of irony: "I did not help the organisation think in new ways."
They were competent but not curious. They waited for instructions instead of wondering what else might be possible.


Higgsfield, the AI video startup that hit $200 million in revenue with a tiny team, runs a hiring process that takes less than 10 days from first interview to offer. Their VP of Talent explained the philosophy: "You don't wait to learn everything first." They're not hiring people who need to be taught. They're hiring people who will teach themselves, who will poke at the edges of what's possible without being asked. That's not a quirk of one fast-moving startup. It's becoming the baseline expectation.


Philip Tetlock studied political forecasters for years, tracking who got predictions right and who got them wrong. The better forecasters were "self-critical, eclectic thinkers who were willing to update their beliefs when faced with contrary evidence." 


He called them foxes. The worse forecasters were hedgehogs, people with one big idea they stretched to explain everything. The foxes won because they stayed curious. They held their opinions loosely. They kept asking questions even after they thought they knew the answer.


This matters more now because AI has changed what execution is worth. When average execution becomes free, or close to it, the premium shifts to judgement, taste, and the willingness to explore.


Anthropic designed a take-home engineering test to identify top candidates. It was working well. Then Claude Opus 4 was released, and it scored better than all the human candidates. Anthropic modified the test to make it harder. Then Claude Opus 4.5 was released and again outperformed all the humans. Their response: they now give candidates the test and invite them to apply if they can beat the AI's performance.


That's not a story about AI replacing humans. It's a story about what humans need to demonstrate when AI handles the baseline. The bar moved. And what the bar now measures is whether you can ask questions the AI wouldn't think to ask.


Dan Koe calls agency "the meta-skill that creates defensible creative work." His definition: "the ability to act without permission or outside prompting." He argues it's developed partly through curiosity, which he describes as "personal filtering of signal from noise."
His point: "Staying on the default path society wants you on is a surefire way to get replaced." Not that robots will take your job, but that people who are more curious than you will take it first. And the robots will help them do it faster.
Curiosity is not a personality trait. It's a behaviour. And like any behaviour, it can be practiced, reinforced, and taught.


The people getting hired at fast-moving companies are the ones who "don't wait to learn everything first." The people getting fired at traditional companies are the ones who execute perfectly but don't "help the organisation think in new ways." The forecasters who outperform are the foxes. Anthropic now hires people who can beat the AI.


And every night, I'm in the playroom trying to get my ten year old twins to fall in love with reading. Not because reading is the skill. But because reading builds the curiosity that builds everything else. I'm not teaching them a fact. I'm hopefully transmitting a behaviour. The habit of wondering. The willingness to poke.
