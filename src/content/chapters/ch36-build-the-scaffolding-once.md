# Chapter 36: Build the scaffolding once

_Part 3_

Every now and again, I catch myself starting from scratch and I kick myself. Because I know how to build assistants and templates, and I think in systems by nature. Then I’m sitting there at 09:30 with twelve tabs open, writing a research brief, pulling bits from a Notion page, an old deck, three Slack threads, and a doc someone last edited in 2022.

I’m copying chunks into a blank window like it’s the first time I’ve ever done the job. Same stitching as last time. Same stitching as the time before that. It’s not even hard. It’s just fiddly, like trying to build IKEA furniture with the little Allen key they give you, while the instructions pretend it’s only six steps.

If you do the same kind of work twice, it’s a signal. The work is trying to become a template. For me it was research briefs. Same pattern every time. Pull sources from a few places, summarise what matters, decide what we still don’t know, turn it into a plan someone can act on. So I stopped treating it like a one-off and built the scaffolding once.

I made a simple home for it. One place where the definitions live, what I mean by positioning, what a good brief looks like, what I don’t want, the tone, the bar. Then I added examples, two or three briefs that were actually good, not just fine. 

Next time I had to write one, I started there. The difference isn’t that the tool suddenly became a genius. The difference is I wasn’t feeding it scraps and hoping it guessed right. I was giving it the shape of the job. They treat systems like a way to save time. It’s not just time. It’s consistency. It’s less variance. It’s fewer mornings where you open a blank window and end up with something that looks decent but isn’t anchored to anything real.

When I left Miro last summer, I pushed this further and built a whole marketing setup like this. Strategy, positioning, messaging, planning, creative, copy. Not because I’m a framework addict, but because I didn’t want to keep re-explaining the same context and acting like that was fine. Some bits worked better than others. Content was strong. Creative was harder. Strategy surprised me, then caught me out, then got better again. That’s normal. Systems are messy at first.

There’s a trap worth naming though. Speed without scaffolding just moves the mess somewhere else. Drafting gets faster and review becomes the bottleneck. Output multiplies and standards become the bottleneck, because someone still has to stop plausible nonsense from getting shipped.

So don’t just build generation. Build checks. Build standards. Build the handoffs between steps. Build the small bits that stop mistakes spreading.

If you’re doing the same kind of work more than twice, make something that holds the context. Then you get the upside. You build the thing, you stay sharp while you build it, and you stop paying the setup cost every single time.
