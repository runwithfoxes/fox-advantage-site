# Chapter 29: Start with what

_Part 3_

Simon Sinek’s 2009 TED talk has over 60 million views. He says “inspired leaders all think, act, and communicate from the inside out.” He draws three circles, Why, How, What, and says the winners start with Why. I’ve seen that line copied into decks with the quote in italics and a big WHY in the middle. Everyone nods.


Inspired leaders may do this, but it’s not an advertising model. 


It’s a leadership story about how to talk. The trouble is it gets positioned as a cause of market success, not just a way of describing a few famous examples.


The proof in the talk is stories. Apple. The Wright Brothers. Martin Luther King Jr. They’re good stories, but they’re still stories. There are no citations, no experiments, no “we tested inside out versus outside in and here’s the lift.” Just examples that fit the pattern.


Then there’s the neuroscience layer, which is where it starts to wobble. Sinek says the brain has three parts that “correlate perfectly” with the Golden Circle. Neocortex equals What. Limbic equals Why. He adds that the limbic brain “has no capacity for language.” A neuroscientist, Paul Middlebrooks, responded: “It’s laughable. There is no reason to appeal to how the brain works to validate the golden circle as an effective business strategy.” That’s about as direct as it gets. The brain talk is there to make it feel solid.


Under that is the “triune brain” idea from Paul MacLean in the 1960s, which contemporary neuroscience rejects. So you end up with a framework that borrows certainty from an old brain model, then uses that certainty to sell a business claim. The circle looks scientific. The science part is not.


If you want to be skeptically optimistic about it, split it into two questions. One: is it useful to start with why when you’re trying to explain a decision, or get a team aligned. Two: does starting with why cause you to win in the market. The first one, maybe, for some organisations, some of the time. The second one is a problem for me.


You see the same move in the purpose evidence people pull in to back up the idea. Jim Stengel’s “Stengel 50” is the most cited one. It selected the top 0.1% of brands that were already successful, then claimed their “purpose” caused success. 


Richard Shotton checked the stocks after publication and found only 9 of 26 beat the S&P 500. So the “purpose causes outperformance” story gets built by starting with winners, then working backwards. It’s tidy, but it’s not a clean test.


If you treat the Golden Circle as a way to organise your own thinking, grand. It can stop you rambling, and it can make a team clearer on what they’re trying to say.
Where it goes wrong is when people treat it like a law of the market, and point at Apple like it proves the law. The two Apple ads everyone quotes, “1984” and “Here’s to the crazy ones,” are the ones that suit the story. They’re purpose first, they’re cinematic, they’re easy to retell. 


But picking the greatest hits is not the same as showing a mechanism. If you look across a lot of Apple’s output, plenty of it feels like it starts with what, the product, the feature, the thing you can hold, the things you can do with it.
