# Chapter 31: The one number you need to grow

_Part 3_

Fred Reichheld’s HBR piece in December 2003 was titled “The One Number You Need to Grow.” He said NPS was “the single most reliable indicator of a company’s ability to grow.” I’ve seen that line copied into decks with the quote in italics and “HBR” doing most of the lifting. Everyone nods.

Then you look at what was actually tested and it’s not as clean as the headline. The original study was roughly 40 companies across seven industries. That’s not tiny, but it’s not enough to turn a survey question into a universal rule. The bigger issue is what Jeff Sauro pointed out in 2018. Reichheld didn’t link NPS to future growth. He linked 2001 to 2002 NPS to growth from 1999 to 2002. So the famous “ability to grow” claim is built on past growth lining up with later advocacy, not a proper forward prediction.

That changes what you can honestly say. “Companies that have been growing tend to have happier customers” is not the same as “this one number tells you who will grow next.” One is boring and often true. The other is a promise, and promises should be tested.
People did test it. In 2007, Timothy Keiningham and colleagues published a rebuttal in the Journal of Marketing. It won the journal’s highest award for marketing practice contribution. Their conclusion was blunt: the research fails to replicate Reichheld’s claim of “clear superiority” over other measures. So the “one number” pitch had serious pushback, and it wasn’t from cranks.

It wasn’t the only pushback either. Morgan and Rego, in Marketing Science in 2006, looked at 80 companies over six years and found average satisfaction scores had greater predictive value than NPS. Which is awkward, if you’ve already built the dashboard around NPS and told everyone it’s the best one.

Then you get the more recent nuance. Baehre and colleagues in 2022 found that change in NPS, not the level, predicts growth, and only in the short term. They also found a simpler “top box” metric outperformed NPS. So even when NPS shows a relationship, it’s not the tidy story people repeat.

And still, by 2020, two thirds of the Fortune 1000 use NPS. Bain, Reichheld’s firm, has handled around 750 NPS implementation projects. None of that proves it works better. It just proves it spreads well.

You don’t need to be cynical to see why. It’s simple. It gives you a number you can track. People like a single dial, especially when the rest of the customer story is messy. And to be fair, the comments you get alongside the score can be genuinely useful, if you read them and if someone actually follows up.

This is where the skeptically optimistic stance helps. NPS isn’t evil. It can be a decent check in. If your score drops and you ring customers, you’ll learn things you would have missed. If your score rises and you start relaxing, it can still make you ask what’s driving it.

Where it goes wrong is when the organisation treats it like a magic predictor, or a badge of honour, or the only thing that matters. Then you start managing the number instead of managing the experience. You get teams nudging people for a 10. You get leaders acting like a 38 is a diagnosis, rather than one imperfect signal.

It’s a useful metric. It just isn’t the miracle the headline promised.
