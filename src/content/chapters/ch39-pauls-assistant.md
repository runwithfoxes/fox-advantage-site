# Chapter 39: Paul’s Assistant

_Part 3_

My phone buzzed on the kitchen counter, beside a mug that had gone cold. It was an email, sent to me by something called “Paul’s Assistant”, like I was important enough to have staff. 
I read it, nodded, then fired back an iMessage from my phone that just said “Add: book a haircut”. Showing off to a robot. I’m not proud. 

I built an assistant. The irony is not lost on anybody I’ve worked with. I’m the last person in an office to figure out how to book a meeting room, how to do expenses and I still haven’t cracked SharePoint. I guess that’s the point. I wanted a system to handle stuff I don’t love doing. 
So I opened Claude Code and wrote what I wanted like I was texting a mate. The brief was simple enough. Sync my to do list, my calendar, and my Gmail. Every morning, send me one email with the day, meetings, tasks, the lot. I needed it to work with my phone too, so we hooked it up to iMessage.

It wasn’t a few clicks but it wasn’t that difficult either. The only real “technical” part was being willing to go into the terminal. Once I got over the look of it, it was just copy, paste, run. When it broke, I pasted the error back in and Claude fixed it, or it tried a less complex way to get the same result.

There were loads of errors. Proper ones. The kind that usually mean you’re about to lose an afternoon. This time it was more like, try, fail, fix, repeat, and each loop was quick enough that you stayed in it.

At one point it got late and Claude suggested we call it a night. I kid you not.
But it worked. The next morning, the email landed. One message. Calendar first, then the tasks, then the bits that matter, the call you forgot about, the thing you said you’d send, the meeting that is definitely going to run long. I didn’t have to go digging. I just read it, standing over my coffee machine and started my work day.

A year ago, that would have meant a developer, a proper tool, or knowing the right person to ask. This time it was a black window, a pile of errors, and me saying “that didn’t work, try again.” We’re all builders now.
