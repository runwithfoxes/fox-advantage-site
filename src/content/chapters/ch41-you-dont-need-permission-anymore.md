# Chapter 41: You don't need permission anymore

_Part 3_

I spent three weeks trying to get a landing page approved once. Three weeks. It wasn't controversial, just a page for a campaign we'd already signed off. But there were rounds. Legal had questions. Brand had thoughts. Someone in product wanted to tweak the messaging. By the time it shipped, the moment had passed and we were already onto the next thing. Half the energy went into getting permission. The actual making was a footnote.

This is how most marketing still works. You have an idea, you write it up, you present it to people who weren't there when you had the idea, they ask questions, you go back and revise, you present again, someone suggests a tweak, you incorporate the tweak, you wait for budget approval, you brief an agency, the agency comes back with options, you pick one, it goes to legal, legal has concerns, you address the concerns, and then maybe, eight weeks later, something ships.

The old model made sense when making things was expensive. If a landing page costs ten grand and takes three weeks to build, you'd better be damn sure it's the right landing page before you start. So you have meetings. You write briefs. You get sign-off. The process exists to prevent expensive mistakes.

But what if the landing page costs nothing and takes an afternoon? What if you can build three versions and test them before the meeting would have finished? The economics flip. The process that was protecting you from expensive mistakes is now creating expensive delays.
Elena Verna built a hackathon platform in five hours. Five hours. It cost her about $300 in credits. The platform got over 2,000 applicants. The traditional version of that project would have been scope the requirements, get engineering capacity, wait for the sprint, build it, QA it, launch it. Weeks, maybe months. She just made the thing.

That's not a flex about speed. It's a flex about not asking.
When you can make a working version yourself, you stop asking "can I try this?" and start saying "I tried this, here's what happened." The conversation shifts from hypothetical to concrete. You're not pitching an idea, you're showing a result.

There's a risk here, obviously. You can ship things that are wrong. You can move fast in the wrong direction. The answer to that is not to slow down and go back to the committee model. The answer is to get feedback faster. Show real users. Watch what they do. Fix what's broken. The people who ship and iterate will beat the people who plan and align, because they're learning from reality instead of from meetings.

Tobi Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, built himself a custom MRI viewer. He wanted to look at his own medical scans in a particular way, so he made a tool to do it. He's a CEO. He could have asked someone to build it. He could have bought something off the shelf. Instead he just made the thing, because making the thing was faster than asking for the thing.

That instinct, the instinct to make instead of ask, is the one worth developing. Not because asking is bad, but because asking has a cost. And the cost is higher than it used to be now that making is cheap.

You don't need permission to try something. You need a laptop and a few hours and the willingness to be embarrassed by the first version. The first version is supposed to be embarrassing. That's how you know you started early enough.
