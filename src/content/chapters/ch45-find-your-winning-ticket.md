# Chapter 45: Find your winning ticket

_Part 4_

AI has turned marketing upside down overnight. Suddenly we can make stuff faster than anyone can possibly consume it. Social posts in seconds. Fifty headlines before coffee. Entire campaigns while waiting for the elevator. Yet amid all this magical creation, a simple truth emerges: big ideas matter more now, not less.

When I think about big ideas, I'm talking about the stuff that sticks around for years. The Honey Monster. Snickers telling us "You're not yourself when you're hungry." The people who "Should've gone to Specsavers." The Milk Tray Man jumping off cliffs for chocolate. Those PG Tips chimps that appeared in over 100 ads. Some vanish but make comebacks, like Carlsberg's "Probably" or Ireland National Lottery's "It could be you" – which disappeared in 2013 until we rediscovered it in 2020 like finding a winning ticket stuffed at the back of the sofa. These aren't just campaigns. They're permanent residents in our collective brain space.

When creation costs nothing, chaos costs everything. AI is killing all the barriers to making stuff. Before, making campaigns of any sort, cost money and took time. Those limits forced us to think before we created. Budget caps and production schedules kept our worst impulses in check.

Now those limits are disappearing. Making new campaigns will soon costs much less to produce. Only our own judgment stops us from constantly starting over. Without a big idea keeping everything together, brands just spray content in all directions without building anything that sticks. More content, less impact. More noise, less memory.

Three forces killing big ideas:

There's (at least) three things fighting against enduring ideas, and AI puts them on steroids.
1. First, the obsession with new stuff. Marketers treat "new" as automatically better than "proven." When someone does reuse a winning idea, they often feel weirdly guilty about it – like they're cheating. Meanwhile, consumers actually like familiar ideas. They just want them served slightly differently.


2. Second, marketers get promoted for change, not consistency. "Built on successful campaign for third year" puts people to sleep. CMO jobs last about as long as milk in your fridge. We've built a system that rewards exactly what hurts brands most – constant reinvention.


3. Third, most marketers don't even know their brand's past successes. They don't study the past. Worse - they don't study the evidence of what can work. They're not just failing to look for winning tickets in the sofa cushions – they don't even realise they should be looking. New marketing team start from scratch, like the previous ten years never happened. It's marketing amnesia as corporate policy.

AI makes it worse. AI amplifies these problems to ridiculous levels. The temptation to constantly create new stuff becomes almost impossible to resist when it's this easy. Need new content? Here's 50 variations in seconds. Want different headlines? Generate 100 before your coffee gets cold. New campaign concept? Coming right up.
When making stuff takes no effort, the trigger finger gets very, very itchy. We're removing the friction that once forced us to think before creating. The result? Marketing departments spewing out content with no unifying idea. More stuff, less memory. More posts, less recognition.
Here's the twist – AI also makes big ideas more powerful than ever. AI isn't for constant reinvention; it's for refreshing ideas that already work. Memory structures are simply the shortcuts people use to recognise and remember brands. They build up through consistency – seeing the same characters, taglines, colours, or scenarios repeatedly.
AI becomes the perfect tool for refreshing these familiar elements without abandoning them. Brands can use AI to serve the familiar in fresh ways – keeping what works while varying how it's delivered.
The multiplication effect Here's what works: Use AI to create tons of marketing communications that all reinforce the same big idea. In the past (6 months ago), refreshing a campaign was expensive and slow. A new radio ad every week? Prohibitively costly. Reacting to yesterday's news? You needed writers on standby and a production studio ready to go.
AI eliminates these barriers. Now small teams of talented creatives can instantly create fresh, engaging content that riffs on current events, responds to competitors, or just keeps things interesting - all while reinforcing your big idea. Instead of making occasional big splashes with completely different messages, you can create a steady stream of fresh content that all builds the same memory. Each piece adds to what came before.
Find or create your winning ticket. Despite the insane amount of disruption. In fact - because of it - the top brand task is the same. Find or create a winning ticket; a big idea worth building on. Some brands need to look in their past - digging through the sofa cushions to find forgotten winners. Others need to create something new that can last. But the mission is the same: get a big idea everyone can rally around.
Once you have that winning ticket, protect it and multiply it like crazy with AI.
