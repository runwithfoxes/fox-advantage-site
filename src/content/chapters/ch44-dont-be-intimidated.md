# Chapter 44: Don’t be intimidated

_Part 3_

Last week I opened a terminal and the cursor sat there blinking at me like a bouncer, waiting for my name to be on the list. I did that thing where you lean in like you know what you’re looking at, even though you’d struggle to find the space bar under pressure. I had Claude open in a separate chat window beside it, basically translating the whole night for me. That’s the setup. Then you realise the “technical part” is mostly just not panicking when a black box starts giving you opinions.
I’m not that technical, so I don’t pretend I am. When I’m using Claude Code and something goes sideways, I copy the terminal output, paste it into Claude, and ask it to explain it in “very very plain language”. Not plain language, very very plain language, like we’re explaining to a golden retriever why the bin is locked. It comes back with, “this line means X, this bit failed because Y, do Z next,” and suddenly the terminal stops being a haunted television and turns into a to do list.
Troubleshooting for me looks like a child showing a teacher a ripped copybook. Here’s what it said. Here’s what I tried. Here’s the bit that scared me. And the chat talks me through it, step by step, without the little sigh you get from a human who was born knowing Git. I keep the terminal on one side, Claude on the other, and I just bounce between them, copy, paste, ask, do, repeat. If there’s a ritual involved, it’s the tiny pause before I hit Enter, like I’m waiting for the house to stop creaking.
My kids make the whole thing worse. They’ll take my phone off me to ask ChatGPT questions about random stuff, like the Premiership football ranking, because they don’t believe I’ll know the answers. They’re essentially asking robots over their dad, sitting right there, alive, paying bills, available for questions. With good reason in fairness. 
Peter Yang described all these tools people get spooked by, Claude Code, Terminal, GitHub, Vercel, and he basically shrugged at the whole lot. “Terminal is kind of like an intimidating thing, but it really isn’t that intimidating. It’s basically just talking to an AI agent and going back and forth with it.” 
Same again with GitHub, “if GitHub is intimidating to you, it really isn’t that intimidating. Like you can just set up a free GitHub account and just follow the steps.” His point was almost boring, which is usually a good sign. “It really just comes down to chatting with AI just like how you chat with AI in Chat GBT Claude or Gemini. Don’t overthink it.”
Once you accept that, the fear starts looking a bit daft. The terminal is not a judgement, it’s a textbox with attitude. GitHub is a website with buttons. Vercel is another website with buttons that deploy things instead of selling you trainers. The “intimidating” part is mostly the costume, the names, the black screen, the idea that you need permission to be there. Under it, you are doing what you always do, asking a question, getting an answer, trying a step, seeing what happens.
So I’ve stopped trying to become a terminal person. I’m a chat person who sometimes visits the terminal with a guide. I paste the lines into Claude, I ask for “very very plain language,” and when the cursor starts blinking like that bouncer again, I just bring my translator back up on the screen and walk past it anyway.
