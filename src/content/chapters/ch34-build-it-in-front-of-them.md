# Chapter 34: Build it in front of them

_Part 3_

Last term in Smurfit, UCD, I stood in front of a room of postgrads with my first book up on the big screen, the remote in one hand, the other hand on the laptop like I was diffusing a bomb. In about 60 minutes I ran deep research on the book to find out about me, did the positioning, wrote a brand on a page, built a messaging framework, built an assistant to judge content against it, wrote 10 blog posts and 5 LinkedIn ads, evaluated the lot, knocked out a Google Slides deck pitching the book to universities, and built a website. When it all worked, the room went properly quiet. It felt like I’d pulled a rabbit out of a hat, except the rabbit was a landing page and it had a CTA.
I’m not telling you that to show off. Well a little. I’m telling you because it’s the clearest example I’ve seen of what marketing can look like when you can build, not just write.
Most marketers were trained to hand things off. You write the brief, someone designs the page. You write the copy, someone builds the email. You suggest the video, someone else edits it. You send a deck around and wait for other people to turn it into something you can click. That was normal. The tools were awkward and the work was split up, so you needed a chain of people to get anything over the line.
Now you can often get a first version made yourself. A real thing. A page. A deck. A basic site. Ads with images. A rough video. Something you can show to a customer, or sales, or your boss, and get a real reaction to.
That’s where you’re useful, when you’re close enough to see what’s actually happening.
If you’re building, you notice the obvious things early. The headline sounds fine in a doc, but on the page it feels like a lie. The button is buried. The form is a pain on mobile. The video takes too long to get to the point. The email sounds warm but the product feels cold. These aren’t big strategic insights. They’re just the details that decide whether the work works.
Chesky has the line I keep coming back to. You can’t delegate understanding. If you’re not in the details, you’re guessing. You’re approving descriptions of the work, not the work.
That’s also why middle management gets awkward. Not because people are useless. It’s because distance is a liability now. If your day is mostly alignment, updates, approvals, and handing things between teams, you’re living off second-hand information. When building gets easier, that layer gets thinner, whether anyone likes it or not.
Elena Verna at Lovable described the same idea in a really practical way. She said they still write specs, but the spec is “always accompanied by a Lovable prototype” that everyone can click around and give feedback on. Not a doc about the thing, the thing. If you’ve ever sat through a meeting where four people argue about what a button should say, it feels like cheating in the best way.
She gave a tiny example that stuck with me because it’s not dramatic. She wants to change the pricing page. She takes a screenshot of their pricing page, drops it into Lovable, says “recreate this pricing page, make these changes”, and sends that to engineering. That’s the request. Here’s the page.
And she says the best part out loud, building does a job that meetings can’t do. An idea can sound brilliant in your head, it can look brilliant in a doc, and then you try to build it and the magic disappears. Grand. Better you learn that in an afternoon than after six weeks of polite check-ins.
It saves you from the kind of project that lives for six weeks as a slide deck and dies the minute it touches a real screen.
