# Chapter 8: Better together

_Part 2_

Five years ago, I wrote a book about foxes and hedgehogs, my theory on the differences between good marketers and mediocre ones. The book title was based on a story by Isaiah Berlin from the 1950s. Ten years ago, Professor Philip Tetlock wrote a really wonderful book where he borrowed this idea of foxes and hedgehogs.


I then nicked this idea from both Berlin and Tetlock. Thanks lads.


Hedgehog marketers organise their thinking around big ideas or ideologies. They have a single lens through which they see the world. When reality doesn't fit their theory, they discard it as irrelevant. The usual stuff: TV is dead. TV is everything. You can't build brands through digital. Digital is everything. Emotion is everything. Emotion is fluffy big-brand B2C stuff only.




Fox marketers are different. They care about observation, not just what should happen. They often have multiple unrelated ideas and approaches, and use many different analytical tools. They choose the appropriate tool depending on the specific challenge. 


They think in probabilities, not certainties, which is why they experiment. Foxes study the past, challenge assumptions, have theories but look for evidence. They understand that human behaviour is messy. They have strong opinions, but hold them loosely. They are open to discovering they were wrong.


What I realised about a year ago is that all the characteristics that I believed were important back then are even more so now. If marketers have these fox characteristics, they're going to thrive in an AI world. Hedgehogs will struggle.


For hedgehog marketers, AI feels threatening. They're stuck in ideologies about how marketing should work. When AI disrupts those established ways, they resist because it challenges their fixed worldview. They're not curious or experimental, so they can't adapt when the fundamental rules change.


For fox marketers, it's exciting. They get to experiment more. It's not just about being faster at what you are good at. They get to do things that they could not do before. There is so much to learn and try. Feels like there's not enough hours in the day. What's fascinating is that the same technology affects fox marketers and hedgehog marketers in completely opposite ways.


When I joined The National Lottery, I believed that we could become one of the best marketing teams in the country if we focused on two areas: behaviours and knowledge. We did become one of the best teams.


At the time, I also acknowledged that tools were part of this. But it was lower down in my thinking. It's not now.


When in Miro, our CEO had a view that leaders must not just manage. They must do. They must be in the weeds. I think he was right. As teams become smaller, we'll see the rise of generalist marketers. An individual can get things done end-to-end without waiting for the input from others. But only if they master the tools.


I'm optimistic about what's in store for marketers, if they become foxes.
