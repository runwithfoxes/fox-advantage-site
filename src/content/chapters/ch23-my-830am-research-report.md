# Chapter 23: My 8.30am research report

_Part 3_

At 8:30am, every morning, I get a text that looks like it was written by a bored lecturer with a grudge. It is an academic research summary about marketing effectiveness, dropped onto my phone while I am still trying to remember what day it is. Same header every time, all caps, like it is announcing a fire drill. It is deeply nerdy. 


I’ve set up ChatGPT to run one proper research pulse a day, then send me a structured summary. It goes out, picks one recent empirical paper, and comes back with a digest I can actually use. Not a “marketing trends” smoothie. One paper, one pass, then it stops.


The interesting bit is the level of instruction you can give these things. I don’t ask it to “find something good”. I tell it where to look and how far to look, like a bouncer with a clipboard. Search Google Scholar for 2022 onward. Scan only the first 20 results. Choose one paper that matches my criteria. Then stop. 


No wandering, no “here are 12 more you might like”, no rabbit holes that feel productive and leave you empty.
Then I make it qualify what counts. It has to be empirical, experiment, quasi-experiment, econometrics, meta-analysis. It has to touch commercial outcomes or a money-shaped proxy. The method has to be described clearly enough that you can check if it is solid. Anything that is pure theory, or vendor-sponsored with hand-wavy methods, gets binned. That sounds strict, but it is just a way of protecting the learning from the part of me that wants an easy answer at 8:31am.


The output format is where the pain becomes useful. I force a split between “what the paper actually found” and “inference for marketers”, with the inference labelled as inference. 


Findings first, in one or two sentences, no interpretation. Then a method breakdown that has to name the design, sample, data, outcome measure, and the identification or counterfactual. It also has to tag the evidence quality, robust, promising, preliminary, unclear, and say why. That little requirement stops the model doing the smooth voice thing where everything sounds equally true.


Finally, it has to end with a decision question. This turns it from trivia into reps, because it forces me to connect the paper to a real world, but without pretending the paper answered everything.
