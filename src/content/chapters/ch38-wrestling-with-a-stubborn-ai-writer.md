# Chapter 38: Wrestling with a stubborn AI writer

_Part 3_

Last week I sat at my desk, training a stubborn AI writer. It was 11:47pm, the tea was cold, and it kept doing that thing where it either forgot the rules or refused to write at all. I was threatening to demote it to banner ads for the rest of its life, then bribing it with the promise of a proper ad if it behaved. That’s the bit.

Even with those little wrestling matches, I don’t think it’s that hard to build an AI writer that can write well. But you must know how to write. You can’t really train a writer, human or robot, if you don’t know what you’re looking at.

I like writing. I’ve studied it obsessively. Story arcs for film scripts. Classic direct response. Hopkins, Caples, Ogilvy. Drayton Bird. Advertising. Bernbach. George Lois. I’m not as good as some of the copywriters I’ve worked with but I know enough. I can look at a paragraph and say, that’s vague, that’s a claim we can’t stand over, that line is trying to sound smart instead of trying to be clear.

That “enough” isn’t a vibe, it’s just reps. Gary Klein puts it neatly, “Intuition depends on the use of experience to recognize key patterns” (Klein, 1998). Herbert Simon is even plainer, “Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition” (Simon, cited in Kahneman, 2011). That’s what’s happening when you read a line and your shoulders tense a bit. You can feel it straight away, it’s trying to impress you instead of telling you something true.
Tina Wong, who trains companies on AI workflows, said the people who end up building the most valuable agentic systems tend not to be engineers. They tend to be people with deep domain expertise, the ones who can smell nonsense in two lines even if it’s written in perfect grammar.

You can build something that produces output in an afternoon. That doesn’t mean you’ve built something good. Good is a judgement call, and judgement calls come from time spent in the domain, not time spent watching tool demos.

Wong is right when she says half the job is looking at what came back and being able to say, this is wrong, and here’s why, and here’s what right looks like. It doesn’t take long to learn how to build a CustomGPT, literally a few hours. Compare that with what it takes to build marketing judgement.

I went back to the stubborn writer after all that, ran it again, and it tried to sneak in another soft, impressive line that meant nothing.
