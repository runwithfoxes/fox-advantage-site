# Chapter 39c: /remember

_Part 3_

A year ago, the most frustrating thing about working with AI was the amnesia. You'd spend an hour teaching it how you write, what your audience cares about, what words you hate, how your business works. Then you'd close the window and it was gone. Next morning, blank slate. Like talking to a brilliant colleague who gets hit on the head every night.

We all felt it. You'd start a session and think, we did this yesterday. You know this. And then you'd type it all out again, slower this time because the novelty had worn off. The context window was a goldfish bowl. Everything lived in the conversation and the conversation had an expiry date.

That was genuinely the biggest complaint about AI for months. No memory. No continuity. Every conversation starts from zero. People built workarounds. Long system prompts. Pasted notes. "Read this before you do anything." It helped, but it was manual. You were the memory. You were doing the remembering and the explaining, and the AI was just receiving it fresh each time.

Here's what changed, and I don't think most people have clocked it yet.

I type `/remember` at the end of a working session. That's it. Claude goes back through everything we just talked about, decisions we made, things I said I liked, stuff that broke, preferences I expressed without really thinking about it. It pulls out the bits that matter and writes them into small context files on my laptop. Not one massive document. Tiny, focused files. How I like my writing reviewed. What my Heineken contact expects. The way my ad pipeline works. What tags to use on my tasks.

Next time I open Claude, those files are already there. I don't explain anything. I don't paste anything. I just start talking and it already knows. Not because it remembered. Because it wrote itself notes last time and read them this time.

That sounds like a small thing. It's not.

Think about what actually happens when a new person joins your team. Day one, they're useless. Not because they're stupid, but because they don't know how things work around here. They don't know that Gary hates long emails. They don't know that the finance team needs two weeks notice. They don't know that the brand guidelines say one thing but the CEO actually wants something else. All that knowledge is in people's heads, in Slack threads, in documents nobody reads.

It takes months for a new hire to absorb that. And even then, they absorb it unevenly. They pick up the loud stuff and miss the quiet stuff. The quiet stuff is usually what matters.

What `/remember` does is compress that months-long onboarding into something that happens automatically, every session. Every time I work with Claude, it gets a little better at being useful to me specifically. Not useful in general. Useful to Paul, with Paul's business, Paul's audience, Paul's preferences, Paul's blind spots.

And here's the bit that I think has proper strategic value. Context is the new moat. Everyone has access to the same AI models. Same Claude, same GPT, same Gemini. The model is commodity. What's not commodity is the context you've wrapped around it. My `/remember` files are useless to anyone else. They're specifically calibrated to how I work. That means the AI I use every day is quietly becoming an asset that nobody can copy, because nobody else has my context.

It's compounding. That's the word people reach for with investments and they should reach for it here too. Each session adds a little. The context files get richer. The answers get sharper. The prompts get lazier, which is the whole point. Teresa Torres called it being lazy with her prompts. She can be lazy because she spent months building context. The laziness is the reward for the investment.

A year ago, AI had no memory and we treated that as a fundamental limit. Now it has memory, but only if you build it. And honestly, we mostly haven't. We're still starting from scratch every morning, same as we were twelve months ago, wondering why the answers feel generic.

The ones who build the context layer will pull away. Not because they're smarter. Because their AI is.
