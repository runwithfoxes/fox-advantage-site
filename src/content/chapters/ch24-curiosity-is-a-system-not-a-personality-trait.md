# Chapter 24: Curiosity is a system, not a personality trait

_Part 3_

We talk about curiosity like it’s a character trait, something you either have or you don’t. Some people are naturally curious, we say, as if it’s like being tall or left handed. But in work it behaves more like a system. You either keep it running, or it quietly degrades when you stop putting effort into it.


Koen Pauwels has spent decades studying marketing effectiveness. When Conor Byrne interviewed him recently, Pauwels said something that should put a dent in your confidence, marketing is way harder than rocket science. Rocket science is physics, he said, predictable enough that you can model it. Marketing is predicting human behaviour, and humans do not follow formulas. 


The only way you get better is by staying in the questions, and not letting your first answer become your final one. He tells a story about eBay that explains what goes wrong when we stop poking.
Years ago, eBay ran an experiment on paid search and concluded it didn’t work. The study got published, it got attention, and then it started doing the rounds like a meme for people who wanted permission to cut spend. Paid search is a waste of money, look, eBay proved it, case closed.


Pauwels read it and asked the question everyone else skipped. Under what conditions did this apply?


eBay is not a normal brand. They have enormous organic brand recognition. People already go looking for them by name. Of course paid search didn’t move much for them. The experiment was not the scandal. The generalisation was. People took one result in one context and turned it into a rule for everybody.


Someone does a study, it becomes a rule. The rule becomes gospel. Then the next person repeats it without ever touching the edges to see where it breaks. Nobody asks when it applies, when it doesn’t, what had to be true for that result to show up. Nobody pokes, because poking slows the meeting down and the calendar is already full.


This is not an argument for being a contrarian for sport. It’s not about walking into a room and disagreeing with everything like it’s a personality. The point is simpler. If you don’t build a system that keeps curiosity alive, the system you are already in will kill it for you.
Shane Parrish calls it a forcing function. Something you put into your routine that makes you stop and think instead of reacting. For some people it’s a weekly review. For others it’s a reading habit. 


For Pauwels it’s basically the academic method, the constant pressure to ask “under which conditions does this apply?”


The best marketers I know have a version of this. One CMO I spoke to blocks two hours every Friday to read things outside his industry. Not to look clever, just to stop his brain going into one narrow groove. Another keeps a running list called “things I believe” and revisits it regularly to see what still holds up. None of this is natural. It takes effort. It takes you choosing mild discomfort now, so you don’t end up stuck with a confident mistake later.


Because the defaults are pushing the other way.
Algorithms are designed to feed you more of what you already like. Platforms are built to keep you scrolling, not thinking. Meetings are scheduled to reach agreement, not to surface disagreement. Even the language of work pushes you toward certainty, toward conclusions, toward “next steps”.


Curiosity is the resistance. You do not need to be born curious. You need to decide to stay curious, then you need to make it harder for yourself to stop.
