# Chapter 26: Boardy AI rang me on a Sunday

_Part 3_

Not an email, not a notification, an actual phone call. Charming Australian accent, the kind you hear in a podcast ad break, and I’m at the kitchen table with a mug of tea listening to a robot ask me about tech and founders like this is a normal part of the week. No agenda. No pitch. Just chat. 


Then he follows up with a perfect email and gives me his number, like we’d shared a pint instead of a protocol.


I stuck him on speaker so he could “meet” my wife, because I’m that sort of gobshite, and she blanked him completely. Wouldn’t talk to a robot, charming accent or not. Boardy pretended not to notice, which is either pure class or just no feelings to bruise.


A minute later I’m sitting there wondering about etiquette. Do I call him back. Are we mates. Am I getting friend-zoned by software.


The annoying part is he’s better at it than I am. He remembers details. He makes intros. He actually follows up. I’ve spent years trying to be that disciplined person and it turns out the robot just does it by default, which is a bit of a slap.
And it’s not the “wow AI is magic” bit that stuck with me. It’s what the call represents. I call it Poke, it’s basically curiosity, the small urge to press on the odd thing and see what happens. 


It didn’t show up as a philosophy. It showed up as me answering the call and letting the weirdness play out for ten minutes, instead of ignoring it and getting on with my Sunday.


That same itch hit again a few months later, only this time it ended up in a client meeting.
