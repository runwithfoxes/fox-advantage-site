# Chapter 20: Gotta put in the reps

_Part 3_

A month into The National Lottery I’m standing in front of a wall with a roll of Blu Tack, sticking behaviours up one by one. By then I knew most people’s coffee order and I’d stopped pretending every meeting had an agenda. One of the behaviours was simple, we won’t win without putting in the work. 

Four years later the lottery topped €1 billion in revenue for the first time. 19 percent up on 2019. Highest year-on-year growth in the company's history. I was named Ireland's Marketer of the Year.

It wasn’t hustle. We set a high bar. We studied. We put the work in. And we committed. We brought in Peter Field, Paul Feldwick, and Phil Barden to train the team. Not a lunch and learn where everyone nods while guarding a sad wrap. Proper sessions. We spent a full day reviewing story arcs, the ones that work and the ones that don’t, using System1 data. Dozens of cases. What made the audience feel something. What left them cold. What got remembered. What got confused with a competitor.

The team did the reps. You can feel the difference when people stop reaching for the neat answer and start asking why it landed.
Roger Martin spent decades studying what separates good strategists from average ones. His answer is boring. They practice. “I have never met this mythical beast called a great natural strategist,” he says. “Great strategists have all one thing in common. They just practice.”

He tells the story of A.G. Lafley, one of the most celebrated CEOs of his generation. People assumed Lafley had some instinct for strategy. Martin dug deeper. Turns out Lafley had been practising strategy since his twenties, in the Navy, testing things out for years before he ever sat in the corner office. He had more reps than almost anyone Martin had met.
Jason Lemkin has a test for mediocre salespeople. Ask them what they’re really good at. “I’m a people person, Lenny,” they say, like it’s on their passport. Then ask them the toughest technical objections to their product. They don’t know. His verdict, “Being a people person is not enough anymore.”

Same in marketing. You can coast on soft skills for a while. Good taste. Nice decks. Knowing the right people. But when AI can generate the deck and write the copy, what’s left is judgement. Knowing if it’s any good. That only comes from doing the work.

Lemkin watched a team at a company worth over $10 billion try to get AI agents working. Twenty people. Months of effort. Nothing. When he asked how much of the work they’d done themselves, nobody answered. “The folks that are lost today have never done it.” That silence tells you more than the roadmap ever will. AI will write you a positioning statement in eight seconds. It will sound fine. It might even sound good. 

But if you haven’t done the reps, you won’t know whether it’s good or just fluent. You won’t feel the thing that’s missing. You won’t hear the sentence that doesn’t land.

The smell for weak work comes from miles, not theory.

When the cost of production drops to nearly zero, the bottleneck becomes judgement. A month in, that wall of behaviours starts to make sense, not as motivation, but as a warning. You earn judgement slowly, by doing the work.
