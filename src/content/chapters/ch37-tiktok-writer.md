# Chapter 37: TikTok writer

_Part 3_

“Barcelona. Beach day. Lost my flip-flops. Found five new friends and someone’s ex.”
That line came back about ten seconds after someone typed a six word brief. Barcelona. Beach. Tapas. Meet new friends. That’s the surprise. Then you look a bit closer and realise the surprise is not the prompt.

This was for a big consumer youth travel brand. Big reach, big customer base, but run lean. I mean lean in the good way, not “we forgot to hire people” lean. The kind of place where if something works, it gets used, and if it doesn’t, it’s gone.

My job started with the normal stuff. Positioning, what the brand is for, what it is not for. The voice, the lines it would say, the lines it would never say even if they tested well. Messaging, so the whole thing is clear enough that two different people can write in it and still sound like the same brand. Boring, useful, and mostly invisible when it’s done properly.

Then we hit the marketing plan. TikTok mattered. Not one big campaign, just a steady flow of ads, quick, funny, tied to real situations, not generic “travel vibes” mush. The problem was simple. They didn’t have a creative team. They didn’t have a copywriter sitting there ready to bang out jokes about a midnight swim, a dodgy hostel, and someone’s ex, five days a week.
So we built the missing bit.

I made an AI writer, a custom GPT, just for TikTok ads in that tone. The training files were not fluffy brand adjectives. They were thousands of real verbatims, the way customers actually talk when they’re sunburnt, buzzing, broke, or slightly regretting their own decisions at 4am. And it had the fundamentals baked in, the positioning, the voice rules, the messaging framework, plus a set of do’s and don’ts so it didn’t wander into brochure talk.

That’s why the prompt can be tiny. The team are not “prompting” their way to a voice. They’re just pointing the tool at a situation and letting it do the repeatable part. From that same short brief, it gave us options like:

“Barcelona. Midnight swim. Met a guy who thinks he’s a DJ. He’s not.”
“Barceloneta. 2pm. Sunburnt, broke, sharing tapas with strangers who feel permanent.”
“Beach to bar. Barcelona. Shared a taxi with two sisters and a magician.”
“Barcelona. 4am. Tapas again. Dorm smells like sunscreen and bad decisions.”
“Barcelona. Beach day. Lost my flip-flops. Found five new friends and someone’s ex.”

You can see the shape. Place first. A time stamp. One small misfortune. One social twist. Then a short verdict line that doesn’t sound like it was approved in a meeting. It feels like someone telling you what happened, which is basically the point of TikTok ads for this kind of brand.
The bit that matters is how it stays consistent. Anyone can get a model to write “funny travel captions” if you keep rolling the dice long enough. The hard part is getting it to sound like this brand, every time, across different cities and situations, without it drifting into the same internet voice everyone else is using. That only happens if the positioning is clear and the voice is distinctive enough to teach.

Tools do not fix vague thinking. They just make it faster. If the brand’s message is mush, you get mush at speed, and you can publish it five times a day. If the fundamentals are solid, the tool becomes a multiplier for a lean team. You go from “we should do more TikTok” to “we can actually do more TikTok”.

We also had it write prompts for images and video. Not fancy art direction, just practical prompts that match the tone and the situation, so the visuals don’t end up looking like stock photos that wandered into the wrong account. It kept everything pointing the same way.
None of this replaces taste. Someone still needs to know what good looks like, and what “on brand” actually means in plain language. But once you have that, you can bottle it enough that a small team can keep up with the pace the channels demand, without hiring a full creative department or burning someone out by Tuesday.

The funny part is the six word prompt. The useful part is everything that had to be true before the five words could work.
