# Chapter 21: Don’t help. Ask me questions

_Part 3_

One of my students sent me a screenshot at 11:07pm last Tuesday, him arguing with a chatbot about positioning like it was a bouncer outside Copper Face Jacks. He’d typed “no, that’s not what I mean” four times, then “don’t help, ask me questions.” The only other thing on the screen was a half-eaten packet of Hunky Dorys and a battery warning. It looked deadly. Then you read it and realise he’d finally found a way to make the thing slightly annoying on purpose.

Ethan Mollick, in an interview with Adam Conover, puts it better than most. “Education has to hurt a little,” he says. Like exercise. Around the same bit, he talks about a Wharton controlled experiment in Turkey where students were allowed to use AI. They got answers to questions, they thought they learned, and they learned nothing, because they were just regurgitating AI information. Same tool, same helpfulness, different result.

Then he flips it. Ask the AI to be like a tutor, he says, because the problem is the AI is helpful, so it just gives you answers. You do not want that. A good tutor challenges you. It makes you answer the question, it guides you. He mentions a World Bank study in Nigeria too, six weeks of after-school AI tutoring with teacher guidance, and a 0.31 standard deviation increase. “That’s equivalent to like an extra year” of learning, he says, to get that kind of impact. That is not “nice to have.” That is “why wasn’t this around when I was trying to figure out what a positioning statement even is.”

Most marketers I know do not have access to that kind of help. They have a manager who is busy, a training budget that got “paused” two years ago, and a Slack channel full of opinions. They have a deck due Friday and a client who wants something “fresh.” They also have a phone in their pocket that will, for about twenty quid a month, sit with them at 11pm and go again, and again, and again, without the raised eyebrow you get when you ask the same basic question for the third time.

The trap is that competence drains out of your fingers. You feel productive because you are producing. Strategies, lines, ads, emails, landing pages. Output is now the cheapest thing in the room. Judgement is what’s scarce. If you rent the model’s competence, you can ship a lot and learn nothing. You can use it to build the competence you never got taught.

That’s the flip side of the warning from Do the Reps. Same tool, opposite instruction. The difference is one instruction. Act like a tutor. Don’t give me the answer. Ask me questions until I can explain it in my own words.
If you want a practical way to hold the line, treat prompting like briefing. Task is what you want done. Instructions are constraints, format, mandatories. 

Context is audience, category, what you’re trying to be famous for. If you cannot write that down, you will get generic output. If you cannot say what good looks like before you ask, you cannot judge what comes back.
Here’s what it looks like when you use it as a tutor, not as a generator.

You draft first. Rough, slightly embarrassing, the way all first drafts are. A positioning statement, a strategic thought, an email outline, whatever you are trying to learn. Then you tell the model it can only ask questions. Twenty minimum. No suggestions, no rewrite, no “here’s a better version.” Questions only. It will start polite, then it will get annoying, which is how you know you are doing it right.

Who is this for. Who is it not for. What do they already believe. What would have to be true for your claim to be credible. Where does your proof live. Answer in writing. If your answers are full of fluff words, tell it to call them out. Make it underline the bits you could swap into any brand and nobody would notice.

Then do teach-it-back. Let it explain the concept to you once, clean and clear. Close the tab. Explain it back in your own words, in writing, like you are texting a mate who asked. Paste that in. Ask it to mark what you missed and what you got wrong. Do it again, shorter. If you cannot say it simply, you do not have it.

You can also switch personas. Ask it to be a critic and stress-test your strategy, not with vibes but with weak points. Ask it to be an interviewer and probe your thinking, the way a sharp client does when they smell a hole. Ask it to be a simulator and role-play a client who subtly misunderstands their own brief, and you practice steering them back without being a prick. It is awkward for about thirty seconds, then you realise you are rehearsing a real skill you usually only get to practice in public.

Add constraints when you want friction. One channel only. No price change. Distinctive assets only. Pretend the media budget got cut in half. See if the strategy still has a spine. If it collapses the minute you remove one comfort blanket, you did not have a strategy, you had a wish.

There’s a story Fei-Fei Li retells about an English teacher grading AI output. This is your floor, the teacher says. If you’re lazy enough to let AI write it, this is what you get. But if you do the work, learn, think, and build on top of it, you can get to A pluses. That’s the clean version of the deal. AI sets the floor. Your fundamentals raise the ceiling.
None of this fixes hallucinations. If it states a fact, you still verify it. None of this replaces doing the work. Mollick says part of it is willpower, and he’s right, because the shortcut is sitting there like a big green button.

 But the hopeful bit is simple and slightly mad when you think about it. He makes the point that every kid in Mozambique has access to the same tool you do. So does every junior in a tiny agency with no mentor, trying to get better between emails and meetings.

Twenty quid a month, available at 11pm, and it will keep asking until your thinking has edges.
