# Chapter 35: Keep the skill in your hands

_Part 3_

I felt the downside of all this on a train last week. Laptop balanced on a backpack, table the size of a Ryvita, and the lad beside me watching something on his phone with the kind of volume that suggests he’s never once been asked to cop on. I was trying to write a simple paragraph before the next stop. I pasted my half-finished mess into Claude and it came back clean, confident, finished. It looked like I’d done good work. That’s the bit. Like I’d suddenly become the kind of person who journals and has matching socks.
Then I went to write the next paragraph without it and my brain went blank, like someone had taken the steering wheel off me without telling me.
DHH talks about “competence draining out of your fingers”. That’s exactly how it feels. Not scary, just slightly embarrassing. If you want to build more, you need to watch that. Because the risk is you get faster at finishing and worse at thinking. You can ship loads and still not trust yourself when something breaks, or when someone asks you why you chose this and not that.
The fix is not a better prompt. It’s changing what you ask the tool to do. When you’re trying to learn, don’t use it like a generator. Use it like a tutor. Act like a tutor. Don’t give me the answer. Ask me questions until I can explain it in my own words.
That’s it. And yes, it gets annoying. That’s the point. A tutor doesn’t let you slide. In practice it looks like this. You put down your own rough version first. A rough hero line, a rough page structure, a rough argument. Something you can stand over, even if it’s not pretty. Then you ask the tutor to interrogate it.
It asks who it’s for, properly. It asks what you can prove. It asks what you’re skipping past. It keeps digging until you stop using soft words.
That’s the rep. You can feel it when you’re doing it properly, because you’re not just choosing nicer sentences, you’re tightening your thinking. The output is a side effect.
Then you swap mode again. Critic, when you want it to punch holes. Simulator, when you want to practise the conversation before you walk into the room. That one is useful because it forces you to say your argument out loud and hear where it goes vague.
One limit, and it matters. If it states a fact, you verify it, or you treat it as a hypothesis and you go look. That’s not paranoia. That’s just normal competence.
So, build things. But keep your judgement switched on while you do it. Otherwise you’re just assembling. And once you’ve got that personal layer working, there’s a second problem that kicks in. You start doing good work, then you waste time doing the same setup over and over.
