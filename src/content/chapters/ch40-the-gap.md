# Chapter 40: The gap

_Part 3_

Last term in Smurfit, UCD, I stood in front of a room of postgrads with my first book up on the big screen, the remote in one hand, the other hand on the laptop like I was diffusing a bomb. In about sixty minutes I ran deep research on the book to find out about me, did the positioning, wrote a brand on a page, built a messaging framework, built an assistant to judge content against it, wrote ten blog posts and five LinkedIn ads, evaluated the lot, knocked out a Google Slides deck pitching the book to universities, and built a website. When it all worked, the room went properly quiet. It felt like I'd pulled a rabbit out of a hat, except the rabbit was a landing page and it had a CTA.


I'm not telling you that to show off. Well, a little. I'm telling you because it's the clearest example I've seen of what marketing can look like when you can make things, not just write briefs about things.
Most marketers were trained to hand things off. You write the brief, someone designs the page. You write the copy, someone builds the email. You suggest the video, someone else edits it. You send a deck around and wait for other people to turn it into something you can click. That was normal. The tools were awkward and the work was split up, so you needed a chain of people to get anything over the line.
Now you can often get a first version made yourself. A real thing. A page. A deck. A basic site. A set of ads with images. A rough video. Something you can show to a customer, or sales, or your boss, and get a real reaction to.
The gap is between marketers who create and marketers who consume.
The Beatles played over 1,200 performances in Hamburg clubs before they had a hit. That's more than most bands play in their entire career. They weren't studying music theory in a library. They were on stage, night after night, figuring out what worked by doing it badly until they did it well. High-volume creation beats high-volume consumption every time.
AI has made that kind of volume possible for marketing. The barriers that used to slow you down, the design skills, the code, the time it takes to get a prototype together, most of them are lower now. Not gone, but low enough that you can step over them if you're willing to try.
But here's the thing. The tools don't do the thinking for you. They make it cheaper to try things, which means the people who actually try things pull ahead of the people who are still waiting for someone else to build the landing page.
Zevi Arnovitz joined Meta as a product manager with no technical background. Typical PM, relied on engineering teams for implementation, sat in the middle of the process doing coordination. Then he started using Cursor and built a workflow that let him ship real products himself. Not prototypes. Products. His engineering colleagues started asking him to teach them how he does what he does.
That's the shift. The PM who used to be the middleman is now the maker. The marketer who used to write the brief is now building the first version. The person who used to consume other people's work is now creating their own.
You don't need to be interested in software to build software. You just need to be interested in good ideas. That's the line from a16z, and it's true. The addressable market for builders has expanded beyond the people who read Paul Graham essays and hang around Hacker News. It now includes anyone who has a problem and is willing to sit with a tool long enough to solve it.
One of my nine-year-old twins built a video game with Claude Code last week. Cowboy shooting aliens in the desert, score counter in the corner, the lot. What got me wasn't that it worked. It was that he thought it was normal. Of course you can build something from your imagination and then play it. His aliens need work, but the point stands. If a nine-year-old thinks this is just how things are now, the excuse that you're "not technical" is starting to sound thin.
None of this means specialists are dead. Good designers, good developers, good analysts, they still matter. But the gap between "I can't do that" and "I can do a rough version of that" has closed dramatically. And rough versions are often enough to learn what you need to learn, to test whether the idea has legs, to show someone what you're talking about instead of describing it in a meeting.
The people who keep consuming, who keep reading about AI instead of using it, who keep waiting for someone else to make the thing, they're falling behind. Not because they're lazy. Because the game changed and they're still playing the old one.
