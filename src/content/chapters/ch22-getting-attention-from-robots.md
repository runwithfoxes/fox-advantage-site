# Chapter 22: Getting attention from robots

_Part 3_

Last week I asked an AI a boring question about a boring feature, which is usually how the odd stuff sneaks in. I typed it out in a full sentence, hit enter, and watched it skim the internet like it had somewhere else to be. It didn’t care about the brand story or the lovely homepage video, it lifted one line from a help article and one line from a third-party page, then handed them back to me like receipts. 

Then you read it and realise what’s changed. You’re not only writing for the person with a coffee in their hand, you’re writing for the machine that’s scanning for something it can take.

Humans still do the human stuff. We want to feel safe buying something. We want to like the look of it. We want to believe we’re not idiots for spending the money.
Machines do something you can actually see. They extract. They look for a claim, a spec, a comparison, a line that answers the question cleanly, and they pull it forward. They don’t get a warm feeling from your positioning. They get a piece of information they can reuse.

Neither replaces the other. If you only talk to the machine, you’ll sound like an instruction manual that’s trying to flirt. If you only talk to the human, you can be invisible at the exact moment someone asks, “which one does X, Y, and Z.”

Traffic from LLMs is climbing fast. A lot of teams are seeing it grow hard year on year, often doubling, but it’s still a fraction of traditional search in most categories.
The bigger shift is how it works.

In traditional SEO, being broadly trusted helped. Links, mentions, decent coverage across the web, it all added up.

LLM answers are pickier. The model is trying to answer one question. It grabs bits it can lift, a clear sentence, a spec, a “yes, but” limitation, and it stitches an answer together. When it shows citations, it tends to lean on the same kinds of shelves for that question, docs, help centres, big review sites, Wikipedia, forums, comparison posts.

So “we’re well known” helps less than you’d like. “We’re named in the places the model keeps quoting for the question we care about” helps more.

A simple test: ask the question you want to win, like “Does [Product] work with Stripe?” If the answer includes sources, treat those URLs as key shelves for that question. Make sure your product is described there in one plain sentence, with the real limitation included, and keep it current. It won’t guarantee you win, but it moves you from missing to available.

John Hegarty is 81 now. His Levi’s work in the mid-1980s is what got me excited about marketing as a career, which is a sentence that makes me feel old in a very particular way.

When he talks about where this is going, it’s worth listening, because he’s not doing the usual panic. He puts it in plain terms. “Your communication has got to have something in it that AI can take.” “AI can't take ‘oh, I felt good.’ Feeling good is how I get to me. But how I get to AI is that I put something within my story that AI goes, I can take that. I understand that.”

He also points out BBH was always “a very old-fashioned advertising agency” because they believed in product demonstration. Double-stitch for extra strength. Audi four-wheel drive, better handling.

His argument is that this becomes modern again. When AI is processing your brand, it needs concrete, demonstrable claims. “Audi four-wheel drive performance, better handling on the road” is something an algorithm can work with. Vague emotional positioning isn’t. The man whose work made me want the job is still telling the rest of us to stop being foggy and start being specific. The long tail is longer now. People don’t ask in keyword fragments, they ask in proper sentences. “I want a website builder with SEO features, Stripe integration, and design portfolio support.” Nobody typed that into Google for years. Someone is asking it now, and they expect one answer, not a list of links.

This is where things get unfair in a useful way. If you are the only product that genuinely fits a very specific question, you can win that query cleanly. Not with a clever ad, but with the boring truth said clearly.

It also changes what counts as “marketing” work. Your help centre becomes a discovery asset. Your product pages stop being brochures and start being evidence. Your feature descriptions, compatibility notes, limitations, pricing edge cases, the stuff you normally hide in a FAQ, it becomes raw material the machine can lift.

And the places that get cited matter more than general noise. You need to know which URLs show up when someone asks the question you care about, then make sure you’re mentioned there in the right sentence.

Write down the ten questions you actually want to be the answer to. Real questions. “Does it integrate with X?”, “Will it work for a portfolio?”, “Can I take payments without an accountant?”

Ask them in the tools your customers use, then note what gets quoted or linked.
Look at your own pages and ask, honestly, do we state the answer in a way a machine can lift without guessing?

If the answer is no, you don’t need a new channel. You need to rewrite what’s already there. This isn’t a new set of skills. It’s the old skills, with less room to waffle. Know what your product actually does. Be able to articulate it clearly. Make concrete claims that can be extracted and checked.

Hegarty called BBH “old-fashioned” for believing in product demonstration. Turns out old-fashioned is modern again, which is either comforting or depressing depending on how many meetings you’ve had this week.

Agentic AI, where your assistant shops on your behalf, is coming. When it lands properly, the “two audiences” thing gets sharper, because the machine won’t just recommend, it’ll choose.

But mass adoption feels like years, not months. There’s time to build the muscle. Learn what gets cited. Fix the pages you’ve neglected. Get serious about making claims you can stand over. The people who do the reps now will look annoyingly calm later.

I went back to that answer the AI gave me and clicked the sources, out of nosiness more than anything. The brand homepage wasn’t there. The glossy video wasn’t there. It was the help article with the one clean sentence, plus a third-party page that happened to say the same thing in plain language.

It didn’t feel like marketing in the moment. It felt like being marked.
