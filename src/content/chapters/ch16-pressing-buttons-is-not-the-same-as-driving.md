# Chapter 16: Pressing buttons is not the same as driving

_Part 3_

My 9 year old twins can make websites and videos now. Give them a few hours and they could spit out a “messaging framework” too, headings, bullets, the whole lot, same way they’ve learned what every button does on our hybrid Kia Sportage. They can tap around that touchscreen with sticky fingers while the car is still doing its little self-check, and it all looks very grown up. But am I letting them drive?


Because pressing buttons is not the same thing as driving. You can find the hazard lights in ten seconds. You can also put the heating on full blast, change the ambient lighting, and turn the radio off mid song, which is a form of cruelty only children enjoy. The car will happily do what you ask. None of that tells you what to do when someone cuts across you at a roundabout, or when the road goes shiny after rain and the stopping distance doubles.


I’ve seen the marketing version of that a few times. Someone brings a shiny new framework into a meeting, all clean headings and confident words. It reads like it’s already been approved by a committee you’ve never met. Everyone nods because it sounds like the sort of thing you’re meant to nod at.


Then one person asks the only question that matters, and the whole thing goes soft.


Not a clever question either. Just, “What would make a buyer pick us over the obvious alternative.” Or, “Show me the proof for that line.” Or, “What are we not.” You can feel the room change. People start looking at the page instead of each other. Someone says, “Well it’s more like a direction.” Another says, “It’s early.” The framework doesn’t collapse because the words were badly arranged. It collapses because no one had decided what they were willing to bet on.


AI makes this easier to fake, by accident as much as on purpose. It can write you something that looks finished in seconds. Smooth sentences. Confident tone. The kind of polish that makes people relax. That polish is useful, until you mistake it for judgement. The machine does not have taste. It does not have nerves. It will not flinch before you ship the dangerous version.


And the dangerous version in marketing is rarely “bad grammar.” It’s the easy lie. The vague promise. The claim that feels good to write and impossible to prove. The kind of line that gets you through a deck review and then falls apart the first time a customer asks a follow up.


Professor Tim Ambler once put it to me in a way I’ve never forgotten. He told that we can’t tell marketers the things they must do to be successful. But we can tell them the things not to do. 


Because “what not to do” is the driving lesson. Don’t take the roundabout too fast. Don’t brake late on wet roads. Don’t say things you cannot back up. Don’t borrow a category claim you cannot win. Don’t confuse a nice sentence with a true one.


My twins get this with Minecraft. They don’t write a spec for a house and then build it perfectly. They throw blocks down, step back, knock half of it down, build again. They learn by seeing the ugly version, then fixing it. The value is in the loop, not the first draft.


AI makes the loop cheap. That’s the win. You can get to a first version fast, then a second, then a third. But it also makes the checking more expensive. The more the machine produces, the more you have to verify. It’s like letting the kids build a forty-page website. Fair play, they can do it. Now you have to click every link, read every line, and make sure it isn’t quietly saying something mad on page 37.
