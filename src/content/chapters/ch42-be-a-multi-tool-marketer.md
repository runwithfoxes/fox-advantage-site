# Chapter 42: Be a multi-tool marketer

_Part 3_

My deep expertise is brand management, creativity, marketing comms, all the stuff you could point at on a billboard from the bus and say, I did that. Big mass brands. Big TV ads. Multi million euro campaigns. National sponsorships with rugby teams. Music venues like The O2. If you asked me to brief a director, pick a track, or kill an idea that’s trying to be clever, I’m your man.
If you asked me to set up a CRM three years ago, I would have started looking for a responsible adult.

That was the old bargain in marketing. You were either the brand person, or the growth person, or the data person, or the “I live inside HubSpot” person. Everyone had their own chair, their own jargon, and their own special little bit of power, mostly because the tools were a pain and the pain made it a job title.

Now the tools are still a pain, but there’s a cheat code. You can talk to them.
I’ve been using AI the way my ma uses a wooden spoon, not fancy, just always within reach. I’m not pretending I’ve become a growth marketer. I’m saying I can do enough of the job to be dangerous, and sometimes enough to be useful. I can build basic systems, stitch a few things together, and get answers without booking a meeting with the one person who “knows the dashboard”.

There’s a mad example doing the rounds from Kyle Poyar about an AI CRM. Alex Shartsis built a functional CRM replacement with Claude Desktop hooked up through MCP to Gmail, Calendar, Grain, and Stripe. Setup took about 20 minutes, it cost $20 a month for Claude Pro, and it handled the stuff people actually use CRMs for, year end prospect lists, weekly pipeline summaries, sales cycle analysis. The line that makes you sit up is the blunt one: “It’ll take you about 20 minutes and cost just $20 a month, all while delivering 90%+ of the value of a CRM.” 

That’s not a nice to have. That’s a small earthquake in the “we need a new system” meeting.
And the joke is, most marketers don’t want a CRM. They want to know who to follow up with, what’s moving, what’s stuck, what to chase, and what to ignore. Traditional CRMs charge you a fortune to eventually tell you what your inbox already knows, only with worse spelling and a consultant’s haircut. If an AI can pull from the places you already live, email, calendar, meetings, payments, and you can just ask it questions like a human, that’s you getting your evening back.

That’s the shift I’m talking about. Marketers have spent years specialising because the work was split by tools. Brand people made the story, growth people ran the engine, data people told you what happened last month, and everyone pretended they enjoyed the handoffs. But if I can take my actual strengths, taste, positioning, creative judgement, and then use AI to bolt on just enough growth to ship, I’m not waiting around for permission anymore.

It’s not about doing everything yourself either. It’s about not being helpless.
The multi tool marketer is not the best at any one blade. They’re just the person who can open the bottle, tighten the screw, cut the cord, and keep going. You still need specialists for the deep stuff. But you don’t need to stop the whole project because you can’t pull a list, write a script, tag a link, set up a simple pipeline report, or automate a follow up.

And if you came up where I did, in the world of big TV and big budgets, there’s a slightly bruising realisation in all this. The advantage used to be access. Access to media. Access to production. Access to the people who knew how to run the systems. Now a chunk of that access is a chat window and twenty minutes of messing about, and the only thing you can’t outsource is taste. Which is handy, because taste is the bit we were supposed to have all along.
The only catch is this. If you’re going to carry more tools, you have to actually pick them up and use them, even if you look like a fool for the first ten minutes.
