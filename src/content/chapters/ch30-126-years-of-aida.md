# Chapter 30: 126 years of AIDA

_Part 3_

We’ve been teaching some version of AIDA since 1898. That’s 126 years of “Attention, Interest, Desire, Action” turning up in briefs, courses, and workshop walls. We treat it like a law. Except the evidence trail behind it is thinner than the confidence it’s given.


Here’s what most of us mean when we say it. People see an ad, it grabs them, they start thinking about it, they start wanting it, then they buy. A clean set of steps. You can plan to “do awareness,” then “build desire,” then “convert,” and it all sounds sensible in a meeting.


The funny part is where it started. Oxford Reference calls AIDA a heuristic for personal selling, not advertising. It was a way to keep a salesperson on track, not a theory built from watching how advertising actually works at scale. At some point it stops being a little memory aid and becomes a big general rule.
Paul Feldwick nails how that happens in The Anatomy of Humbug. He says advertising’s “eternal truths” like AIDA were “just ideas that particular people had had at particular points in time… that happened to catch on because they were simple.” That’s the whole trick. Simple ideas travel. Then after a while we forget they were ever just ideas.


When researchers went back and looked across the evidence, the tidy sequence didn’t hold. Vakratsas and Ambler reviewed 250 plus studies in the Journal of Marketing in 1999 and concluded, “There is little support for any hierarchy, in the sense of temporal sequence, of effects.” In other words, people don’t reliably move through the steps in order, even if the model reads like they should.


You see the same thing in the bigger advertising datasets. Robert Heath at the University of Bath, using Ipsos data from 97,000 subjects across 512 commercials, found advertising can work without that attention to interest sequence. Even people who could not recall the ads at all still showed a 1.2% positive brand shift. You can hate that fact if you like, but it’s awkward for any model that depends on conscious, step by step progress.


And the IPA Effectiveness Databank points in the same direction from the real world side. Across 1,200 plus cases over three decades, emotional campaigns produced 1.7 brand effects versus 1.0 for rational campaigns, and emotional won on all seven brand metrics. A lot of effective advertising works through feeling and memory, not through a neat ladder you can recite.


This is where you stay skeptically optimistic. AIDA isn’t evil. As a prompt, it’s handy. It makes you ask, “Did anyone notice it,” “Did they get it,” “Did it make them want anything,” “Did anything happen next.” When you’re staring at a blank page, those questions help.


Where it gets silly is when we start treating it like science. As if advertising must work in that order, for everyone, every time. Then you see briefs written like lab instructions, first we do attention, then we do interest, then we do desire, then we do action, and the work starts to sound like the model instead of sounding like a person.
