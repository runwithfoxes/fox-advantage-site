# Chapter 44: The fundamentals are the input

_Part 4_

On Friday morning I was in a meeting room where the table was too shiny and the coffee tasted like it had been filtered through regret. 
Someone ran an AI workflow and in the time it took a lad to find the HDMI setting, it spat out a full campaign, ads, emails, landing page, subject lines, even the follow-up sequence. The room nodded along like we’d just watched a magic trick. Then somebody asked what the campaign was actually trying to change. The air went quiet in that very specific way.
That quiet is the new sound of marketing. 
Not because the tools are bad, they’re unreal. It’s because speed has moved the bottleneck. The bottleneck is now the basics, the boring bits we all say we believe in, and then ignore when the quarter gets tight and the machine can produce another pile of “content” before lunch.
I keep seeing the same pattern. The tool makes it easy to ship, so teams ship. The output looks impressive, so everyone relaxes. Then, six months later, you’re working twice as hard to get the same result, and the only obvious lever left is more noise or more discounting. You don’t notice the slide at the start because the graphs are still going up.
This is not a call to go backwards. It’s a reminder, the stuff you already know matters more now, because the penalty for skipping it arrives faster.
The first basic is the one that should embarrass us, and yet it keeps happening. What is the work for. Not what channel it’s for, not what format, not what the tool can generate, what change are you trying to cause. More buyers, not more clicks. Higher price tolerance, not just higher response. Being remembered at the right time, not just being seen by the people who already like you. If you can’t say the job in a plain sentence, the work becomes a bunch of tactics in search of a purpose, and the machine will happily help you scale that confusion.
The second basic is balance, and you don’t need to be a nerd about it to feel it. There is work that pays you back now, and work that pays you back later. The later work is the one that keeps you from having to shout, beg, and discount to be chosen. It’s also the one that gets cut first because it’s slower, and because it’s harder to “prove” in a Tuesday morning update. AI is brilliant at the now stuff. It can generate offers, sequences, variants, retargeting logic, product copy, all day long, without getting tired or second-guessing itself. If nobody protects the later work, the now work expands until it fills everything.
The third basic is remembering that measurement is not the same thing as truth. Short windows reward short behaviour. If your reporting only shows you what happens quickly, you will end up building a system that only values what happens quickly. There’s research that puts numbers on the lag, both in profit and in memory, and you’ve seen it in your own life even if you’ve never read a paper. The thing that wins a click this afternoon is not always the thing that earns a choice next month when the customer can’t remember who you are without being nudged. AI will give you more data, faster. It will not stop you staring at the wrong bit of the picture.
The fourth basic is reach, and this is where the AI story gets properly misleading because personalisation sounds like maturity. “We know our customers.” “We can tailor journeys.” “We can reduce churn.” Fine. Do it. Just don’t pretend it’s the growth plan.
Sharp’s work on how brands grow is a useful cold shower here. Big brands have more buyers, small brands have fewer, and the difference is mostly about how many people buy you at all, not how deeply you can mine the same base. Romaniuk’s work in B2B makes the same point in a way that’s hard to wriggle out of, for most brands the bigger problem is unawareness, not rejection. People aren’t saying no after careful evaluation, they’re not even putting you in the set of options.
AI makes it easier to talk to the people who already know you, more often, more precisely, with nicer copy. It makes it dangerously easy to do that while you stay invisible to everyone else. If your plan is mostly retention, and “we’ll do awareness later”, you’re asking a very powerful machine to help you stand still.
The fifth basic is being recognisable, and this is the one AI will wreck by accident because it produces variation like a slot machine. New lines, new angles, new tones, new visuals, and it all feels productive because there’s so much of it. Meanwhile your brand cues get diluted, and the work starts to look like it could belong to anyone with the same template and the same stock library.
Romaniuk’s research on distinctive assets is the clearest way to say it without making it mystical. The consistent bits, the cues people can tag back to you without thinking, do more heavy lifting than your strategy doc ever will. That’s not art talk, it’s memory talk. And memory is messy. Ask the same person the same question twice and you will get a different answer a frightening amount of the time, not because they’re lying, because their brain is not a filing cabinet. Consistency is how you stop that from killing you.
This is the part where AI can be genuinely useful, if you have discipline. If you know the cues you are protecting, AI can help you spread them across formats you used to avoid because they were a pain. If you don’t know them, or you keep fiddling, AI will help you be average everywhere, quickly and at scale, which is a strange achievement.
The sixth basic is choosing. Not optimising, choosing. Fame work, the kind that gets talked about, tends to be underused for the simple human reason that it makes leaders nervous. The safe version always wins in a room because no one gets blamed for safe. AI will give you the safe version by default, the middling version that offends no one and is forgotten by everyone. If you want something with bite, someone has to back it, then the tool can help you show it in more places, more often, without rebuilding it from scratch every time.
When teams ask what to do with AI, the answer is not a prompt library. It’s making the basics painfully explicit, so nobody can hide behind output.
You should be able to walk into a stand-up and hear the job stated clearly, not “we need a campaign”, but what change you’re trying to cause. You should be able to point to what you are doing for memory, not just what you are doing for response. You should be able to explain what your measures miss, not just what they show. You should be able to name how you are reaching people who have never heard of you. You should be able to list the cues you’re protecting without turning it into a branding workshop.
Most teams know all of this. They just stop acting like it when the tools get exciting.
AI turns that old gap between what we know and what we do into a bigger problem, because it lets you move fast with your eyes closed. You do not need a smarter machine. You need the boring habits that stop you feeding it rubbish.
