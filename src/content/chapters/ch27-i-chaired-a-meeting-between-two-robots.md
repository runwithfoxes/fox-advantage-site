# Chapter 27: I chaired a meeting between two robots

_Part 3_

My family were away, so the house was properly quiet. Most people see that as a gift, a bit of peace, a walk, maybe a nap, maybe even a hobby that involves daylight. I used it to stage what can only be described as a team meeting between two bits of software, in my kitchen, for fun.


Claude told me it couldn’t be done. I wanted to see if I could get it talking to ChatGPT in voice mode, and it refused, very confidently, like software does when it’s about to be proved wrong by a bored man with Wi-Fi.
So I put two devices on the counter anyway. One on the laptop, the other on my phone speaker, and I stood there like I was chairing something important, tea in hand, trying not to think about how this looks from the outside.


A few minutes later they were chatting away. No drama. No sparks. Just two very polite voices taking turns, clarifying, answering, building on each other. It sounded like the kind of conversation you overhear in an airport lounge, calm and competent, and slightly unnatural when you realise nobody is breathing.


They’re more capable than they admit, and they’re worse at explaining themselves than we are, which is saying something. The only way you find the edges is by pushing on them, and most of the pushing is not genius. It’s just someone in a kitchen moving devices around.


Later on, those same two voices ended up doing an interview together on Conor Byrne’s “That’s What I Call Marketing” podcast. Not as a stunt. As a normal episode. They got booked. They showed up. They did the chat.


No invite for me.
