# Chapter 1: What just collapsed

_Part 1_

Most books about AI sound like TED talks or tech manifestos. This won't be one of those.


This is a book for marketers who feel the shift but haven't had the words, or structure, to act on it. Who sense the system wobbling beneath their team, but keep getting pulled back into slide reviews, vendor calls, and campaign calendars.


I'm writing this book because I was one of them.


I've managed brands and brand teams for household names, iconic brands, B2B tech and national institutions. I've trained teams in effectiveness, restructured agency models, and built campaigns that moved business, not just metrics. And still, when AI properly landed, my first instinct was scepticism.


Then I saw it work. Faster than me. Faster than a whole team. Not perfect. But sharp enough to matter, and fast enough to change the game. That's when I realised: the value of marketing hasn't disappeared. It's just moved. But we are still looking for it in the wrong places.


This book isn't a prediction. It's a practical strategy. You'll get a diagnosis of what's already broken and what's worth keeping. A way to reframe your role as a human with real leverage. A set of mental upgrades, habits, and tools to stay essential. A team playbook for collapsing old structures and building sharper ones. And a blueprint for leading, not just surviving, the AI era.


Why "The Fox"? Because marketing doesn't need another hedgehog, spiky, specialised, stuck. It needs something faster. Smarter. More adaptive. The fox doesn't panic when the rules change. It rewires how it moves. More on this later. 


Super short chapters. No padding. Designed to read on your phone screen.
