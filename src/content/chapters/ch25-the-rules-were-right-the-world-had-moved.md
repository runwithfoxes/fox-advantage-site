# Chapter 25: The rules were right. The world had moved.

_Part 3_

When Philippe Thomas published a paper saying reach isn't the holy grail, I opened it immediately, like the Ticketmaster scramble for Oasis in Croke Park last summer.


The finding was uncomfortable. Eighty percent of the campaigns in his dataset were optimising for reach. The planners weren't idiots. They were doing exactly what the prevailing wisdom told them to do. Get your message in front of as many eyeballs as possible. Reach is the foundation. Everything else flows from there.


Except when Thomas looked at actual business outcomes, the picture fell apart. Only one percent of campaigns were anywhere close to efficient. The bulk were getting around 1.75% lift when 18% was sitting on the table.


That's not a rounding error. That's a ten-times gap between what was possible and what was being achieved.
The problem wasn't execution. The planners were good at their jobs. The problem was the question everyone had stopped asking.


Thomas puts it sharply. A view on Facebook and a view on TV are completely different things, even on the same human being. They're non-fungible. They do different jobs through different mechanisms. One might be brilliant for recognition, another for recall, another for building associations over time. Treating them as interchangeable units of "reach" is like treating a hammer and a screwdriver as interchangeable units of "tool."


Thomas had to prove to reviewers that the industry wasn't already doing this right. So he ran the analysis and found that campaigns were optimised beautifully for reach, getting 85 to 95 percent of maximum possible reach, and simultaneously nowhere near optimised for outcomes. The correlation between "planned well according to conventional wisdom" and "actually worked" was essentially random.


The managers weren't wrong. They were following the rules. The rules were wrong. Or rather, the rules were right for conditions that no longer applied, and nobody had bothered to check. He found the same pattern with media mix. The "synergy" everyone talks about, the idea that channels work better together, turns out to be two completely different things mashed into one word. There's complementarity, where channels do different jobs and don't overlap. And there's cross-effects, where the presence of one channel amplifies the power of another. These are different phenomena requiring different decisions. But because we called them both "synergy," we stopped seeing the distinction.


Thomas reckons there's maybe two years of abnormal returns available for marketers who figure this out before pricing adjusts. Two years where you can outperform competitors who are still optimising for the wrong thing. But only if you stop long enough to check whether the playbook still fits the pitch.
