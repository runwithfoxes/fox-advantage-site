# Chapter 46: Marcel

_Part 4_

Character assets are some of the strongest distinctive brand assets we have. And still only around 15% of ads use them. Not because marketers hate mascots. Some do. 


But they can be slow, expensive, and fiddly in the real world. Anybody that has made ads with puppets knows my pain. 
A mascot used to mean a puppet maker, an animator, a voice, a shoot, studio time, post-production, and a terrifying moment where everyone stares at the monitor trying to agree whether the eyebrows look “friendly” or “possessed”. 


Stef Hamerlinck has removed the reason people avoid making them.He has a blue dog called Marcel. Marcel shows up weekly in short-form drama videos. He shows up in newsletters. He shows up as lip-synced talking clips. He shows up as generated imagery across dozens of scenarios, still recognisably the same dog. He even shows up inside an interactive site called Marcel OS, and in the first 24 hours it pulled 5k visitors, 56 hugs, and 35 generated images.


The important thing is this is not a one-off. It’s a machine. Stef can deploy Marcel daily across formats, on his own, at tiny cost.


He did it again for a real retailer. Dreamy, a mascot for Belgian toy retailer Dreamland, went from a kitchen-table sketch with his daughter to a national launch in weeks. The Belgian Prime Minister turned up along the way, which is not a sentence you normally get to write about mascot production. The speed is the point. The gap between “we should do a character” and “the country has now met the character” has collapsed.
You can list the tools and it’ll sound like he lives inside a browser tab jungle. Scenario for asset management. Ideogram character to insert himself or humans into scenes. Seedream 4 for image editing and combining characters. Seedance Pro and Kling for video and animation. Veed Fabric for lip-sync. ChatGPT for script iteration, with a dedicated Marcel project holding context and personality. Midjourney conversation mode for early exploration. Flux LoRa for custom training so Marcel stays consistent.
But the tools are not the story. The way he works is.
Stef collects 20+ ideas per week in Notion. Not vague “content pillars”, actual scenes, lines, setups, the kind of ideas you can build. Then he plans hard. He used to spend roughly 30% of his effort planning and 70% brute-forcing generations. He flipped it. Now it’s closer to 70% planning, 30% generating.
That sounds like admin. It’s production.
It means he is not sitting there asking the model to save him. He is deciding what Marcel is doing, where he is, what the joke is, what the point is, and only then pushing pixels around.
He also does something that feels obvious, which is why most people skip it.
Before he starts anything new, he checks if he already has something similar.
Scenario is his memory. Everything he has generated is stored and searchable by prompt, colour, model, scene. So if he needs “Marcel in a kitchen” he doesn’t start from nothing. He finds the closest existing frame and edits. The work stacks up instead of disappearing into a folder called “final_v7_reallyfinal”.
That is what turns mascot work from a series of heroic pushes into a steady output line. Reuse is not a bonus, it’s the whole engine.
His other big constraint is first frames.
He creates all the first frames before he generates video. He locks the pose, the lighting, the composition, the expression, the scene logic. Only then does he move into animation. It stops him wasting time animating the wrong idea, and it keeps Marcel coherent when the format changes from still to motion to talking head.
When Marcel talks, Stef lip-syncs. When Marcel needs to stay in character, Stef writes and rewrites scripts inside a dedicated ChatGPT project that holds Marcel’s tone and personality. When Stef is exploring early, he’ll use Midjourney conversation mode like a stream of consciousness, then tighten it once he sees the shape.
None of that is mystical. It is the same discipline you’d apply in traditional production, just faster and cheaper.
He also expects waste, which is another way of saying he’s not pretending this is effortless.
Stef expects about 1 in 10 generations to be usable. That is not an AI confession, it’s a filmmaking attitude. You plan for the misses. You do not build a process that collapses emotionally at generation number seven.
He reuses assets constantly. He automates with node-based workflows so he’s not making the same tiny decisions every day. He sticks with mature, cost-efficient models rather than chasing the newest releases, because the job is output, not bragging rights.
So if you’re a CMO reading this, what are you meant to take from a man and his blue dog.
Not “go buy these tools.” Not “mascots are back.” Not a debate about whether characters work.
The change is simpler. The old excuse no longer holds.
Mascots used to be expensive and slow because production was expensive and slow. Now one person can run a character across weekly video, newsletters, a website, talking clips, and hundreds of images, and keep it consistent enough that people recognise it instantly.
That shifts the decision from budget to operating model.
Do you have someone who can own the character end to end, not in a committee way, in a shipping way.
Do you have a library, not a folder, so the work compounds.
Do you have a steady idea habit, so the character shows up outside campaign season.
Do you lock first frames, so motion work has something stable to build on.
Do you expect waste, so you don’t declare the whole thing “a fad” after a bad afternoon.
Stef’s work makes a slightly awkward point for the rest of us. If you still do not have a character, the reason is less likely to be money or time now. It’s more likely that nobody has built the machine.
Marcel is not a mascot in a wardrobe. He’s a coworker who keeps turning up, week after week, in whatever format Stef feels like making that day. And the hug counter is sitting there, ticking up, like it’s the most normal KPI in the world.
