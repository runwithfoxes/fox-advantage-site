# Chapter 18: Look for the smell

_Part 3_

Last Tuesday I was in a windowless meeting room with a plate of stale biscuits and a marker that squeaked every time it hit the whiteboard. 


Someone read out an AI “positioning line” like it was scripture, perfect cadence, perfect punctuation, even a little ™ stuck on the end for bravery. It looked the part. Then you ask one normal question, “so what do we actually do differently?”, and everything kicks off. 


It’s not that the line was bad. It was worse than that, it was fine, and fine is how nonsense gets shipped now, with a straight face and a nice font.


I can usually tell an AI answer is wrong before I can explain why. Sometimes it’s a plan that has the right headings and nothing underneath. Sometimes it’s a promise that sounds confident but doesn’t pin itself to anything. 


You only notice if you’ve done enough real work, the messy kind with deadlines and budget rows, to know what weak looks like when it’s dressed up.


That flinch matters more than it did a few years ago because AI is getting brilliant at looking correct. Sometimes it is correct. Sometimes it’s close enough that a human can fix it. And sometimes it’s miles off, written cleanly enough that nobody wants to be the first person to say, hang on, what are we even talking about.
Terence Tao has a good name for what’s missing. 


He calls it a “sense of smell”, the feeling that you’ve taken a wrong turn even if each step looks fine on the page. He’s talking about maths, but it lands in marketing without much effort. The skill is not sounding smart, it’s catching the wrongness early, before you build a month of work on top of it.


One caveat, because this is where people get caught. Feeling certain tells you nothing about being right. Confidence is just a sensation, and AI is brilliant at handing it back to you in tidy sentences. You can feel sure and still be wrong, which is fairly common in meeting rooms.


Gary Klein found the same thing in a very different place. He studied firefighters. The interesting part was how quickly they moved. They didn’t sit there weighing up ten options and picking the best one. They’d see a situation, recognise it, try a move in their head, and if something didn’t fit they changed course fast. It wasn’t magic. It was reps.


Marketing has its own version of that. You read a strategy line and it either forces a choice or it doesn’t. You look at a brief and you can feel where the contradiction will blow up later, usually when everyone is tired and the deadline stops being theoretical. AI will write you a lovely line either way. It does not care if it cashes out into real decisions.


That’s why the risk is different now. The output can look finished. The slides can look finished. The work can feel finished. Then you try to use it and realise nothing was decided.


So when we say “keep standards”, we’re not talking about status. We’re talking about fitness. The basics, done often enough that you can spot the soft bit early.
