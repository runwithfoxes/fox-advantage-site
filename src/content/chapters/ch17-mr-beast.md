# Chapter 17: Mr Beast

_Part 3_

When not building stuff with AI, Max and Alex watch MrBeast. They sit on the sofa, eyes glued to the screen like it’s a Champions League final penalty shootout. Last week one of them paused a video at 0:47 and told me, dead serious, “That bit’s where he hooks you.” He’d a pencil in his hand like he was marking it. 


Most people think MrBeast is a big-budget chaos merchant. Shouty thumbnail, fireworks, someone screaming in a warehouse, and a prize that sounds like a typo. That’s the surface. Under it, the fella is basically a lab technician for attention, and the lab is YouTube.


He spent years not making videos, but studying them. He talks about being locked in a room for basically five years, and on some days he and a few other nerds would sit there for twenty hours straight looking at tiny stuff, like whether better lighting at the start means less viewer drop-off. It does. Imagine telling your family you can’t come to dinner because you’re on hour seventeen of “lighting at the start.” You’d be disowned, and you’d deserve it, but you’d also be right.


That’s what mastery looks like when you zoom in. Not the stunts, the repetition underneath them. The same question asked a thousand times, with better notes each time. He cares about the first minute like it’s the only minute. Not in a poetic way. In a “this is where we lose people, every time” way. And he’s not guessing. He’s the sort of person who knows the exact second viewers click off. Not “around the middle.” Not “people trail away.” The second.


It sounds obsessive because it is obsessive. 


But it also makes it simple. If people bail at 0:12, you don’t need a better ending. You need to stop messing about at the start. He knows the average length of his own videos too, 13 minutes 37 seconds. That number is so specific it sounds made up, which is usually the sign it isn’t. Nobody invents 13:37 for the craic. That’s someone with a sheet open, a row of videos, and the patience to count properly.


Then there’s the title and thumbnail, which looks like nonsense until you see how strict he is about it. The title promises a thing. The thumbnail backs the promise up. The video has to deliver that exact thing quickly, or people feel tricked and they’re gone. The promise and the delivery have to match, not because it’s virtuous, but because audiences punish the mismatch without even thinking about it.


You can see how sharp this gets in the ketchup versus yard example. “I Survived 50 Hours In Ketchup” does numbers. “I Spent 50 Hours In My Front Yard” dies quietly. Same length, same effort, same structure, and one of them gets swallowed by the feed. It’s not because ketchup is art. It’s because ketchup has texture straight away. You can picture it, smell it, feel the stickiness. The yard is just a yard. Most people have one, or know someone who does, and nobody needs to click a video to understand it.


That’s not luck. That’s pattern recognition, earned the slow way.


The other thing he’s fierce on is watching the work, properly watching it. He’s said he talks to new people who have seen five or six of their videos and he’s genuinely baffled by it. Not performatively baffled. Proper baffled. It’s the equivalent of joining a band after hearing one chorus. You can’t learn the feel of something you’ve only met in passing.


“You can’t get inspired by things you don’t know exist.” That line does a lot of heavy lifting. If your input is thin, your output is going to be thin, even if it’s tidy. If you haven’t sat with enough of the work, you can’t spot what’s missing. You won’t notice when the pacing is off by ten seconds. You won’t feel when a promise is wobbling. You’ll be working off vibes, and vibes are expensive.


The hours are inside the result like the stitches inside a football. You only notice them when the ball splits.
That’s why his production document doesn’t read like “advice” in the usual way. It’s not big thoughts about creativity. It’s the boring, concrete stuff, written down by someone who got tired of relearning it. First minute matters. Lighting matters. Match the promise. Track where people leave. Keep improving or the difficulty outgrows you. It’s a checklist from a lad who has already made the mistakes, already paid for them, and would rather not pay twice.


And it’s weirdly funny that we’ve reached a point where you can make a “video” in minutes. Script, voice, clips, captions, the lot. Perfect spelling, perfect pacing, even a little swell of emotion on cue, like it learned feelings from a training manual. 


Meanwhile the biggest YouTuber alive is sweating the nano stuff, the first few seconds, the exact second people leave, whether the start looks crisp, whether the title promised ketchup and the video delivered ketchup.


My kid unpaused the video after his little 0:47 diagnosis and watched the next twenty seconds like a hawk. Pencil still in hand, like he was ready to catch him out.
