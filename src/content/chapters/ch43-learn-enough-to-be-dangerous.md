# Chapter 43: Learn enough to be dangerous

_Part 3_

The first landing page I built myself looked rough. Genuinely rough. The spacing was off, the button colour was wrong, and the headline read like it was written by someone who’d skimmed a marketing textbook on a train. I sent it to a designer friend and she came back with a list of fixes longer than the page itself.
But here’s the thing. It existed. I could click on it. I could show it to someone and say, what do you think of this, and the feedback was about the idea, not about whether the idea was worth building. That’s the difference.
You don’t need to be a great designer. You need to be good enough to make a first version that doesn’t make people wince too hard.
You don’t need to be a developer. You need to know enough to build a landing page, wire up a form, get something working that you can put in front of a real person.
You don’t need to be a data analyst. You need to be able to pull numbers, spot patterns, and know when something looks wrong.
You don’t need to be a copywriter. You need to write clearly, edit ruthlessly, and know the difference between a line that sounds clever and a line that actually lands.
The job now is not to master one thing. It’s to be dangerous at several things. Dangerous enough to ship a first version without help. Dangerous enough to know when the AI output is off. Dangerous enough to have an opinion that’s grounded in actually doing the work, not just reading about it.
That’s not the old generalist. The old generalist was a coordinator. They could talk to the specialists, they could run the meeting, they could send the notes, they could point at the Gantt chart like it was a weapon. The new version can actually make things. Not as well as the specialist, but well enough to move.
Marketing used to reward specialists because the tools demanded it. You needed years of training to be a good designer. You needed to actually know how to code to build a website. You needed proper chops to do analysis. The barriers were real, and they justified the division of labour.
The barriers are lower now. Not gone, but lower. A marketer with AI tools can produce design work that’s good enough for testing. They can build a working prototype without writing code from scratch. They can analyse data without a statistics degree. The floor has dropped, which means the excuse for not trying has dropped too.
And the part people miss is you don’t need confidence, you need a process. Copy the problem. Paste it into the chat. Ask for plain language. Do the next step. Repeat. It’s not romantic, but it works, and it beats the classic approach, which is staring at the screen until you decide you were never meant to be the sort of person who does this.
You don’t need to be an expert before you start. You need to be willing to start before you’re an expert, and keep going until you’ve learned enough to be dangerous.
The traditional career path was pick a specialism, go deep, become the expert, get hired for that expertise. The new path is learn enough about several things to ship work without depending on other people, then go deeper on the things that matter for the problem in front of you.
Two judgement heavy generalists with taste and AI fluency can now do what used to require five specialists. You see it in small teams shipping faster, because they can write the page, launch the test, pull the numbers, tweak the message, and do it again before anyone has time to call a meeting about it.
